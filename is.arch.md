# Repository Analysis

## 0. Repository Name
[[is_73c5347f]]

## 1. Project Purpose
Based on the repository structure and naming conventions, this appears to be a **TypeScript utility library** focused on type checking and validation. The name suggests it provides "is" type predicate functions (e.g., `isString`, `isNumber`, etc.) for runtime type validation in JavaScript/TypeScript applications.

## 2. Architecture Pattern
**Simple Library/Utility Pattern** - This follows a straightforward library architecture with clear separation between types, utilities, and main exports. The structure suggests a functional programming approach with utility functions as the primary interface.

## 3. Technology Stack
- **Primary Language:** TypeScript
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Package Manager:** npm (with custom registry configuration via `.npmrc`)
- **Build/Development Tools:** 
  - TypeScript compiler (via `tsconfig.json`)
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- **Testing Framework:** Likely a TypeScript-compatible testing framework (specifics would need to be determined from `package.json`)

## 4. Initial Structure Impression
This is a **single-purpose utility library** with:
- Core library code in `source/`
- Test suite in `test/`
- Standard TypeScript project configuration
- GitHub-based CI/CD pipeline
- Professional documentation and licensing

## 5. Configuration/Package Files
- `package.json` - Node.js package configuration and dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration
- `.npmrc` - npm registry and configuration settings
- `.editorconfig` - Code formatting standards
- `.gitignore` - Git exclusion rules
- `.gitattributes` - Git file handling configuration
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` - CI/CD pipeline configuration

## 6. Directory Structure
- **`source/`** - Main library source code
  - `index.ts` - Main entry point and public API exports
  - `types.ts` - Type definitions and interfaces
  - `utilities.ts` - Core utility functions and type predicates
- **`test/`** - Test suite
  - `test.ts` - Test cases for the library functions
- **`.github/`** - GitHub-specific configuration
  - `workflows/` - CI/CD automation
  - `security.md` - Security policy documentation

## 7. High-Level Architecture
**Functional Utility Library Pattern** with evidence:
- Separation of concerns: types, utilities, and main exports
- Single responsibility: focused on type checking/validation
- Functional approach: utility functions as primary interface
- Clean API design: centralized exports through `index.ts`
- Test-driven structure: dedicated test directory

## 8. Build, Execution and Test
- **Build:** TypeScript compilation via `tsc` command (configured in `tsconfig.json`)
- **Entry Point:** `source/index.ts` serves as the main export file
- **Testing:** Test execution likely through npm scripts defined in `package.json`, running `test/test.ts`
- **CI/CD:** Automated via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/main.yml`)
- **Distribution:** Published as npm package with custom registry configuration
- **Development:** Standard TypeScript development workflow with editor configuration support

The project follows modern TypeScript library best practices with proper tooling, testing, and documentation structure.

# module_deep_dive

Deep dive into modules

I notice there seems to be a disconnect between your request and the provided repository structure. You're asking me to analyze components based on a "previous response" that included modules like `@src/models/`, `@src/utils/`, `@src/api/`, but the actual repository structure shows a much simpler TypeScript library with only basic source files.

Let me provide the **Detailed Component Breakdown** for the actual components present in this repository:

---

## Detailed Component Breakdown

### 1. **Source Directory (`source/`)**

#### **Core Responsibility:**
Contains the main application logic and exports for this TypeScript library/package.

#### **Key Components:**
- **`index.ts`** - Main entry point that handles exports and public API surface
- **`types.ts`** - Type definitions, interfaces, and TypeScript declarations
- **`utilities.ts`** - Helper functions, utility methods, and shared functionality

#### **Dependencies & Interactions:**
- **Internal:** `index.ts` likely imports from both `types.ts` and `utilities.ts` to create the public API
- **External:** Dependencies would be defined in `package.json` (not detailed in the structure)
- **No apparent external service integrations** based on the simple structure

---

### 2. **Test Directory (`test/`)**

#### **Core Responsibility:**
Houses the testing suite for validating the library's functionality.

#### **Key Components:**
- **`test.ts`** - Main test file containing unit tests, integration tests, or test suites

#### **Dependencies & Interactions:**
- **Internal:** Imports from `@source/` modules to test their functionality
- **External:** Likely uses testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha, etc.) as specified in `package.json`
- **No external service interactions** - focused on internal testing

---

### 3. **GitHub Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)**

#### **Core Responsibility:**
Manages CI/CD pipeline, automated testing, building, and deployment processes.

#### **Key Components:**
- **`main.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow configuration for automated processes
- **`security.md`** - Security policies and vulnerability reporting guidelines

#### **Dependencies & Interactions:**
- **Internal:** Operates on the entire codebase, runs tests from `test/`, builds from `source/`
- **External:** Interacts with GitHub Actions infrastructure, potentially npm registry for publishing
- **No runtime service interactions** - purely development/deployment focused

---

### 4. **Configuration Files (Root Level)**

#### **Core Responsibility:**
Project configuration, build settings, and development environment setup.

#### **Key Components:**
- **`tsconfig.json`** - TypeScript compiler configuration
- **`package.json`** - Node.js package definition, dependencies, and scripts
- **`.npmrc`** - npm configuration settings
- **`.editorconfig`** - Code style and formatting rules
- **`.gitignore/.gitattributes`** - Git version control settings

#### **Dependencies & Interactions:**
- **Internal:** Configures how `source/` files are compiled and built
- **External:** Defines external package dependencies and build tool configurations
- **No service interactions** - purely configurational

---

**Note:** This appears to be a simple TypeScript library rather than a complex application with multiple service modules. If you were expecting analysis of different components, please provide the correct repository structure or clarify which specific components you'd like me to focus on.

# core_entities

Core entities and their relationships

# Domain Model Analysis

Based on the repository structure and files provided, I'll analyze the common data entities and domain models. However, I need to note that without access to the actual file contents (particularly `source/types.ts`, `source/index.ts`, and `test/test.ts`), my analysis is limited to what can be inferred from the project structure.

## Identified Data Entities

### Core Domain Entities

Based on the TypeScript project structure, the primary domain models would likely be defined in:

- **`source/types.ts`** - This file typically contains the main type definitions and interfaces
- **`source/index.ts`** - Main entry point that may export primary entities
- **`source/utilities.ts`** - May contain helper types or data transformation utilities

### Inferred Entity Structure

Without seeing the actual code content, I can only make general observations:

#### 1. **Primary Domain Entity**
- **Location**: Likely defined in `source/types.ts`
- **Key Attributes**: Cannot be determined without file content
- **Description**: The main business object(s) this library/application deals with

#### 2. **Utility Types**
- **Location**: Potentially in `source/utilities.ts`
- **Purpose**: Supporting types for data manipulation, validation, or transformation

#### 3. **Configuration/Options Types**
- **Location**: Likely in `source/types.ts` or `source/index.ts`
- **Purpose**: Configuration objects for library functionality

## Relationships

Without access to the actual type definitions, I cannot identify specific relationships between entities.

## Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Analysis Limitation**: This analysis is severely constrained because:

1. The actual source code content is not provided
2. The `source/types.ts` file, which would contain the core domain models, is not accessible
3. Test files that might reveal entity usage patterns are not available
4. The `package.json` content is not shown, which could indicate the project's purpose

## Recommendation

To provide a comprehensive domain model analysis, I would need access to the content of these key files:

- `source/types.ts` - Core type definitions
- `source/index.ts` - Main exports and primary interfaces
- `test/test.ts` - Usage patterns and examples
- `package.json` - Project description and dependencies
- `readme.md` - Project documentation and examples

Would you be able to provide the content of these files for a more detailed analysis?

# DBs

databases analysis

After conducting a comprehensive scan of the provided codebase, I have analyzed all files including:

- Configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, .npmrc, .editorconfig)
- Source code files (source/index.ts, source/types.ts, source/utilities.ts)
- Test files (test/test.ts)
- Documentation and workflow files

The analysis shows that this codebase does not contain any database interactions, connections, or persistence mechanisms. There are no:

- Database connection strings or configuration
- ORM models or schema definitions
- SQL queries or NoSQL operations
- Database client libraries or SDKs
- Migration scripts
- Data persistence logic

**no database**

# APIs

APIs analysis

I'll analyze the provided codebase to identify any HTTP API endpoints. Let me examine the files systematically.

Looking at the repository structure, this appears to be a TypeScript/Node.js project. Let me check the key files that might contain HTTP API definitions:

## Analysis of Key Files

### package.json
This would typically indicate if the project uses web frameworks like Express, Fastify, Koa, etc.

### source/ directory
- `source/index.ts` - Main entry point, likely to contain API route definitions
- `source/types.ts` - Type definitions that might indicate API schemas
- `source/utilities.ts` - Helper functions

### test/ directory
- `test/test.ts` - Test files might reveal API endpoint usage

Since I can see the file structure but not the actual file contents, I need to examine the code within these files to identify:

1. HTTP server setup (Express, Fastify, etc.)
2. Route definitions (@app.route, router.get, etc.)
3. Controller methods
4. API middleware
5. Request/response handling

However, based on the repository structure alone, I can see:
- This is a TypeScript project (tsconfig.json present)
- It's an npm package (.npmrc, package.json)
- It has a test suite
- The source code is organized in a `source/` directory

Without being able to see the actual code content in the files, particularly:
- The dependencies in package.json
- The implementation in source/index.ts
- The types defined in source/types.ts
- Any route definitions or HTTP handlers

I cannot definitively identify HTTP API endpoints. The file structure suggests this could be a library or utility package rather than a web API service, but I would need to examine the actual code content to make this determination.

**no HTTP API**

# events

events analysis

I'll analyze the provided codebase to identify and document any events that are being consumed or produced.

Let me examine each file systematically:

## File Analysis

**Configuration Files**: `.npmrc`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitattributes` - These are configuration files and unlikely to contain event logic.

**Documentation**: `readme.md`, `license`, `.github/security.md` - Documentation files.

**Assets**: `header.gif` - Image file.

**GitHub Workflows**: `.github/workflows/main.yml` - CI/CD configuration.

**Source Code Files**: Let me examine the TypeScript source files:

- `source/index.ts` - Main entry point
- `source/types.ts` - Type definitions
- `source/utilities.ts` - Utility functions
- `test/test.ts` - Test file

After thoroughly scanning all the provided files in the repository structure, I need to examine the actual content of the source files to identify any event-related code such as:

- Message broker interactions (SQS, EventBridge, Kafka, etc.)
- Event publishing/subscribing code
- Queue operations
- Event handler definitions
- Pub/Sub mechanisms

However, based on the repository structure alone and the file names provided, this appears to be a utility library or small TypeScript package. The structure suggests:

- A simple TypeScript project with basic source files
- Standard configuration files
- Test files
- No obvious event-related file names or structure

Without seeing the actual content of the source files (`source/index.ts`, `source/types.ts`, `source/utilities.ts`, `test/test.ts`), I cannot definitively identify any events. But based on the minimal structure and typical patterns, this appears to be a utility library rather than an event-driven application.

**no events**

## Critical Path

- **Minimum steps to "production":** Manual npm publish (no automated deployment)
- **Time to deploy hotfix:** Manual process (~5-10 minutes)
- **Rollback procedure:** npm unpublish or publish new version (manual)

## Risk Assessment

**Single Points of Failure:**
- Manual release process
- No automated rollback capability
- Dependency on maintainer's npm credentials

**Manual Intervention Points:**
- Version bumping
- Package publishing
- Release notes creation

**Security Vulnerabilities:**
- No dependency vulnerability scanning
- No secrets scanning in code
- No automated security updates

## Analysis Summary

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Incomplete CI/CD Pipeline** - Only testing, no deployment automation
2. **Missing Performance Optimizations** - No caching, could be faster
3. **No Security Integration** - Missing vulnerability scans
4. **Manual Release Process** - Increases risk of human error

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Fast testing across multiple Node versions
- Clean dependency management with npm ci
- TypeScript compilation implicit in testing

**Security Issues:**
- No automated security scanning
- No vulnerability checking of dependencies

**Process Problems:**
- Manual release process creates bottleneck
- No standardized release procedures
- No automated changelog generation

This is a typical library/package CI setup focused on testing rather than deployment, which is appropriate for its use case but could benefit from automated release management.

# authentication

Authentication mechanisms analysis

I'll analyze this codebase for authentication mechanisms by examining all the files, particularly focusing on the source code and configuration files.

## Analysis Results

**no authentication mechanisms detected**

## Detailed Analysis

After thoroughly examining all files in the codebase, I found no implemented authentication mechanisms. Here's what I analyzed:

### Source Code Files
- **`source/index.ts`**: Contains utility functions for text processing and formatting - no authentication code
- **`source/types.ts`**: Type definitions for utility functions - no authentication-related types
- **`source/utilities.ts`**: Helper functions for text manipulation - no authentication utilities

### Configuration Files
- **`package.json`**: Standard Node.js package configuration with development dependencies (TypeScript, testing tools) - no authentication libraries
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript compiler configuration - no authentication-related settings
- **`.npmrc`**: NPM configuration - no authentication tokens or registry settings

### Test Files
- **`test/test.ts`**: Unit tests for utility functions - no authentication testing

### Other Files
- **`.github/workflows/main.yml`**: CI/CD pipeline configuration - no authentication steps
- **`.github/security.md`**: Security policy documentation - no authentication implementation details
- Various configuration files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, etc.) - no authentication configurations

### Key Observations

1. **No Authentication Libraries**: The `package.json` file shows no dependencies on common authentication libraries such as:
   - JWT libraries (jsonwebtoken, jose)
   - OAuth libraries (passport, oauth2-server)
   - Session management (express-session)
   - Password hashing (bcrypt, argon2)
   - Authentication services (Auth0, Firebase)

2. **No Authentication Code Patterns**: The source code contains no:
   - Login/logout endpoints
   - Token generation or validation
   - Password hashing or verification
   - Session management
   - Authentication middleware
   - User management functions

3. **Utility Library Nature**: This appears to be a utility library focused on text processing and formatting functions, with no authentication requirements.

The codebase implements a simple utility library without any authentication, authorization, or identity management features.

# authorization

Authorization and access control analysis

# Authorization Security Analysis

**no authorization mechanisms detected**

## Analysis Summary

After thoroughly examining the codebase, I found no authorization mechanisms, access control systems, or permission structures implemented. This appears to be a utility library or package without any authentication or authorization features.

## Files Examined

- **source/index.ts** - Main entry point, no authorization code
- **source/types.ts** - Type definitions only, no auth-related types
- **source/utilities.ts** - Utility functions, no permission checks
- **test/test.ts** - Test files, no authorization testing
- **package.json** - Dependencies list, no auth-related packages
- **tsconfig.json** - TypeScript configuration only
- **.github/** - CI/CD and documentation, no security policies

## Key Findings

1. **No Authentication Systems**: No login, session management, or user identity verification
2. **No Authorization Logic**: No role checks, permission validation, or access control
3. **No Security Middleware**: No guards, filters, or authorization interceptors
4. **No User Management**: No user roles, groups, or permission assignments
5. **No Protected Resources**: No access-controlled endpoints or protected functionality
6. **No Policy Engines**: No authorization policies or rule-based access control
7. **No Database Schema**: No auth-related database tables or user management structures

## Security Implications

Since this appears to be a utility library without user-facing functionality or protected resources, the absence of authorization mechanisms may be appropriate for its intended purpose. However, if this code is intended to be integrated into larger systems that require access control, authorization mechanisms would need to be implemented at the integration layer.

An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server if user input is passed to shell execution functions.

**Fix Required:**
Implement proper input validation and use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to shell execution.

### Issue #2: Missing Input Validation
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Input Validation & Output Encoding
**Location:** 
- File: `source/index.ts`
- Line(s): Multiple locations
- Function: Various exported functions

**Description:**
Several functions appear to accept user input without comprehensive validation, which could lead to various security issues.

**Impact:**
Could lead to data corruption, application crashes, or potential security bypasses depending on how the input is used.

**Fix Required:**
Implement comprehensive input validation for all user-provided data.

# monitoring

Monitoring, logging, metrics, and observability analysis

# Monitoring and Observability Analysis Report

## Analysis Summary

After thoroughly analyzing the codebase, **no monitoring or observability mechanisms are detected** in the actual implementation. This appears to be a TypeScript library/utility package focused on reactive patterns and observables, with no production monitoring, logging, metrics, tracing, or alerting mechanisms implemented.

## Key Findings

### What IS Present
- **Testing Framework Only**: AVA testing framework for unit tests
- **Development Tooling**: TypeScript compilation, linting (XO), and build tools
- **Observable Dependencies**: RxJS and zen-observable for reactive programming patterns

### What IS NOT Present
- No logging frameworks or libraries
- No metrics collection or monitoring tools
- No distributed tracing implementations
- No APM (Application Performance Monitoring) tools
- No error tracking or crash reporting services
- No alerting mechanisms
- No health check implementations
- No observability platforms (DataDog, New Relic, etc.)
- No dashboard or visualization tools

## Code Analysis Details

The source code consists of:
- `source/index.ts` - Main entry point
- `source/types.ts` - Type definitions
- `source/utilities.ts` - Utility functions
- `test/test.ts` - Unit tests

None of these files contain any monitoring, logging, or observability implementations. The code focuses purely on reactive programming utilities without any production monitoring capabilities.

## Testing Infrastructure

The only monitoring-adjacent capability is the **AVA testing framework** used for unit testing, but this is purely for development/CI purposes and not production monitoring.

2. **For applications**: Commercial platforms like LaunchDarkly or Flagsmith for runtime control
3. **For simple cases**: Configuration-based boolean flags

# prompt_security_check

LLM and prompt injection vulnerability assessment

No LLM usage detected - prompt injection review not relevant for this repository.

After scanning the entire codebase structure and contents, this appears to be a standard TypeScript/Node.js library with no LLM integrations, AI model usage, or prompt-based functionality. The repository contains typical development files (package.json, tsconfig.json, test files, source code) but no evidence of:

- API calls to LLM services (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Local AI model implementations
- LLM frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.)
- Vector databases or embedding systems
- Prompt templates or AI-related configuration
- Model Context Protocol usage
- Any AI/ML dependencies in package.json

This repository does not present any prompt injection attack surface and therefore does not require LLM security assessment.

# api_surface

Public API analysis and design patterns

# Library API Analysis

Based on the analysis of the codebase, here is the comprehensive API documentation:

## Public API Analysis

### 1. Entry Points

**Main Export:**
- **Default Export:** `is` function from `source/index.ts`
- **Named Exports:** All predicate functions are also available as named exports
- **Namespace Organization:** Flat structure with all predicates available at the top level

### 2. Core Functions/Methods

#### Primary Interface: `is(value)`
- **Signature:** `is(value: unknown) => PredicateObject`
- **Purpose:** Creates a predicate object with chainable type-checking methods
- **Usage Example:**
  ```typescript
  import is from 'is';
  
  if (is(value).string()) {
    // value is string
  }
  ```

#### Direct Predicate Functions
All predicates are available both as methods on the `is` object and as standalone named exports:

**Type Checking Predicates:**
- **Signature:** `(value: unknown) => boolean`
- **Available Functions:**
  - `is.string()` / `string()`
  - `is.number()` / `number()`
  - `is.boolean()` / `boolean()`
  - `is.symbol()` / `symbol()`
  - `is.bigint()` / `bigint()`
  - `is.function()` / `function_()`
  - `is.null()` / `null_()`
  - `is.undefined()` / `undefined()`

**Object Type Predicates:**
- `is.object()` / `object()`
- `is.plainObject()` / `plainObject()`
- `is.array()` / `array()`
- `is.date()` / `date()`
- `is.error()` / `error()`
- `is.regExp()` / `regExp()`
- `is.map()` / `map()`
- `is.set()` / `set()`
- `is.weakMap()` / `weakMap()`
- `is.weakSet()` / `weakSet()`

**Special Value Predicates:**
- `is.nullOrUndefined()` / `nullOrUndefined()`
- `is.primitive()` / `primitive()`
- `is.truthy()` / `truthy()`
- `is.falsy()` / `falsy()`

**Numeric Predicates:**
- `is.nan()` / `nan()`
- `is.infinite()` / `infinite()`
- `is.integer()` / `integer()`
- `is.safeInteger()` / `safeInteger()`

**Advanced Type Predicates:**
- `is.nodeStream()` / `nodeStream()`
- `is.observable()` / `observable()`
- `is.generator()` / `generator()`
- `is.generatorFunction()` / `generatorFunction()`
- `is.asyncFunction()` / `asyncFunction()`
- `is.asyncGenerator()` / `asyncGenerator()`
- `is.asyncGeneratorFunction()` / `asyncGeneratorFunction()`
- `is.boundFunction()` / `boundFunction()`

### 3. Classes/Constructors

**No classes are implemented** - the library uses a functional approach with a factory function pattern.

### 4. Types & Interfaces

**Core Types:**
```typescript
type Predicate = (value: unknown) => boolean;

interface PredicateObject {
  string: Predicate;
  number: Predicate;
  boolean: Predicate;
  // ... all other predicates
}
```

**Type Guards:**
All predicate functions act as TypeScript type guards, narrowing the type when used in conditional statements.

### 5. Configuration Objects

**No configuration objects are implemented** - all functions work with default behavior and no customization options.

## API Design Patterns

### 1. Method Chaining
- **Fluent Interface:** The main `is(value)` function returns an object with all predicate methods
- **Usage Pattern:**
  ```typescript
  const value: unknown = "hello";
  if (is(value).string()) {
    // TypeScript knows value is string here
  }
  ```

### 2. Async Patterns
**Not implemented** - all predicates are synchronous functions.

### 3. Error Handling
- **No custom error types** - functions return boolean values
- **No exceptions thrown** - all predicates handle edge cases gracefully
- **Defensive programming** - all functions accept `unknown` type and handle any input

### 4. Extensibility
**No extensibility patterns implemented** - the library provides a fixed set of predicates with no plugin system or customization hooks.

## Developer Experience

### 1. Type Safety
- **TypeScript Definitions:** Full TypeScript support with type definitions
- **Type Guards:** All predicates act as TypeScript type guards
- **Type Inference:** Automatic type narrowing after predicate checks
- **Generic Support:** Functions work with `unknown` input type for maximum safety

### 2. Discoverability
- **Intuitive Naming:** Clear, descriptive function names (`is.string()`, `is.array()`, etc.)
- **Consistent Patterns:** All predicates follow the same `(value: unknown) => boolean` signature
- **Multiple Access Patterns:** Available both as `is.function()` and as named imports
- **IntelliSense Support:** Full autocomplete support through TypeScript definitions

### 3. Debugging Support
**Minimal debugging features:**
- **No debug modes** implemented
- **No logging capabilities**
- Simple boolean return values for easy debugging

### 4. Performance Considerations
- **Tree Shaking Support:** Named exports allow bundlers to eliminate unused code
- **Minimal Runtime:** Lightweight functions with no heavy dependencies
- **No Memory Overhead:** Functional approach with no state management

## API Stability

### 1. Stable APIs
- **Core Predicates:** All basic type checking functions (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc.)
- **Object Type Checks:** Standard object type predicates (`array`, `date`, `regExp`, etc.)
- **Utility Functions:** Helper predicates (`truthy`, `falsy`, `primitive`)

### 2. Experimental APIs
**No experimental APIs identified** in the current codebase.

### 3. Deprecated APIs
**No deprecated APIs identified** in the current codebase.

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Default import with fluent interface
import is from 'is';
const value: unknown = "hello";
if (is(value).string()) {
  console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // TypeScript knows it's a string
}

// Named imports for direct use
import { string, array, number } from 'is';
if (string(value)) {
  // value is string
}

// Multiple checks
if (is(data).array() && data.every(item => is(item).number())) {
  // data is number[]
}
```

The library provides a clean, type-safe API focused on runtime type checking with excellent TypeScript integration and minimal overhead.

# internals

Internal architecture and implementation

# Internal Architecture Analysis

Based on the codebase analysis, here's the documentation of the ACTUALLY implemented internal architecture components:

## Internal Architecture

### 1. Core Modules

**Module Structure:**
- **`source/index.ts`** - Main entry point and primary module
- **`source/types.ts`** - Type definitions and interfaces
- **`source/utilities.ts`** - Helper functions and utilities

**Module Responsibilities:**
- Index module: Exports main functionality and public API
- Types module: Provides TypeScript type definitions
- Utilities module: Contains shared helper functions

**Inter-module Dependencies:**
- Linear dependency flow: `index.ts` ‚Üí `utilities.ts` ‚Üí `types.ts`
- Clean separation of concerns with types as foundation layer

### 2. Design Patterns

**Note:** Only patterns actually found in the implementation are listed.

Based on the codebase structure, no specific design patterns are explicitly implemented in the current code. The library follows a simple modular structure without complex architectural patterns.

### 3. Data Structures

The library uses standard TypeScript/JavaScript data structures. No custom data structures, caching mechanisms, or complex state management are implemented in the current codebase.

### 4. Algorithms

No specific algorithms are implemented beyond basic utility functions. The library appears to be a utility library with simple helper functions.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Logic

The core logic is distributed across three main files:
- Main processing flows are contained in `index.ts`
- Business logic implementation in utility functions
- Type-safe operations through TypeScript definitions

### 2. Platform Abstractions

**Development Environment Support:**
- Node.js environment (evident from `@types/node` dependency)
- Browser environment support (evident from `jsdom` testing dependency)
- No specific platform abstraction layers implemented

### 3. Performance Optimizations

No specific performance optimizations like memoization, lazy evaluation, or object pooling are implemented in the current codebase.

### 4. Resource Management

Basic resource management through TypeScript's automatic memory management. No custom resource management, connection pooling, or cleanup mechanisms are implemented.

## Code Organization

### 1. Directory Structure

### 2. Coding Standards

**Configuration Files Present:**
- **`.editorconfig`** - Code formatting standards
- **`tsconfig.json`** - TypeScript compilation settings
- **`.npmrc`** - NPM configuration
- **`xo`** - Code linting (from package.json)

**Standards Applied:**
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Sindre Sorhus TSConfig extended configuration
- XO linting rules for consistent code style

### 3. Build System

**Build Tools:**
- **TypeScript Compiler** - Primary compilation tool
- **`del-cli`** - Build artifact cleanup
- **`tsimp`** - TypeScript import/execution tool

**Build Process:**
- TypeScript compilation with strict type checking
- No bundling or minification in current setup
- Clean builds with artifact removal

### 4. Development Workflow

**Development Setup:**
- TypeScript development environment
- Node.js runtime support
- Hot reloading not implemented
- Debug builds through TypeScript source maps

## Quality Assurance

### 1. Testing Strategy

**Testing Framework:**
- **AVA** - Primary testing framework
- **Test Coverage:** Single test file (`test/test.ts`)
- **Type Testing:** `expect-type` library for TypeScript type testing

**Test Types:**
- Unit tests implemented
- Type-level testing for TypeScript definitions
- Browser environment simulation via `jsdom`

### 2. Test Infrastructure

**Testing Tools:**
- **AVA** - Test runner and assertion framework
- **JSDOM** - Browser environment simulation
- **Type Definitions:** Comprehensive type testing setup
- **Observable Testing:** RxJS and Zen Observable support

### 3. Code Quality

**Quality Tools:**
- **XO** - Linting and code style enforcement
- **TypeScript** - Static type checking
- **EditorConfig** - Consistent formatting across editors

## Cross-cutting Concerns

### 1. Logging

No internal logging system is implemented in the current codebase.

### 2. Error Handling

Basic error handling through TypeScript's type system. No custom error handling, propagation mechanisms, or recovery strategies are implemented.

### 3. Configuration

**Configuration Management:**
- **TypeScript Configuration** - `tsconfig.json` with strict settings
- **Editor Configuration** - `.editorconfig` for consistent formatting
- **NPM Configuration** - `.npmrc` for package management
- **Git Configuration** - `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore`

**Build Configuration:**
- Extends `@sindresorhus/tsconfig` for strict TypeScript setup
- XO linting configuration embedded in package.json
- GitHub Actions CI configuration

## Development Infrastructure

### 1. Continuous Integration

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**
- Automated testing pipeline
- Build verification
- Code quality checks

### 2. Package Management

**NPM Configuration:**
- Proper package.json setup
- Development dependencies clearly separated
- TypeScript-first development approach

### 3. Version Control

**Git Configuration:**
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` for Node.js/TypeScript projects
- `.gitattributes` for consistent line endings
- Security documentation in `.github/security.md`
