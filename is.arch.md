## 0. Repository Name
[[NOT_FOUND]]

## 1. Project Purpose
Based on the minimal structure with TypeScript source files including `utilities.ts`, `types.ts`, and `index.ts`, this appears to be a **TypeScript utility library or npm package**. The project seems designed to provide reusable utilities, types, and functions that can be consumed by other projects. The presence of `.npmrc` and standard npm package structure suggests this is intended for distribution via npm registry.

## 2. Architecture Pattern
**Library/Package Architecture** - This follows a typical npm library structure with a clear separation between source code, tests, and build configuration. The architecture is designed for modularity and reusability.

## 3. Technology Stack
**Primary Technologies:**
- **TypeScript** - Core language (evidenced by `tsconfig.json`, `.ts` files)
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment (evidenced by `.npmrc`, `package.json`)
- **npm** - Package management

**Build & Development:**
- TypeScript compiler for transpilation
- Standard Node.js/npm toolchain

*Note: Specific dependencies and versions would require examination of the `package.json` file contents.*

## 4. Initial Structure Impression
This appears to be a **single-purpose TypeScript library** with:
- **Source code** (`source/` directory)
- **Test suite** (`test/` directory) 
- **CI/CD pipeline** (`.github/workflows/`)
- **Standard npm package configuration**

No evidence of frontend/backend split - this is a focused utility library.

## 5. Configuration/Package Files
- `package.json` - npm package configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration
- `.npmrc` - npm configuration
- `.editorconfig` - Editor formatting rules
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns
- `.gitattributes` - Git attributes configuration
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

## 6. Directory Structure
- **`source/`** - Main source code directory
  - `index.ts` - Main entry point/barrel exports
  - `types.ts` - Type definitions and interfaces
  - `utilities.ts` - Utility functions and helpers
- **`test/`** - Test suite
  - `test.ts` - Test implementations
- **`.github/`** - GitHub configuration
  - `workflows/` - CI/CD automation
  - `security.md` - Security policies

## 7. High-Level Architecture
**Modular Library Architecture** with clear separation of concerns:
- **Types layer** (`types.ts`) - Defines contracts and interfaces
- **Utilities layer** (`utilities.ts`) - Implements core functionality
- **Public API** (`index.ts`) - Exposes public interface

Evidence supporting this pattern:
- Separation of types and implementation
- Single entry point pattern
- Standard library project structure

## 8. Build, Execution and Test
**Build Process:**
- TypeScript compilation via `tsc` (configured in `tsconfig.json`)
- Automated builds likely handled by GitHub Actions (`main.yml`)

**Main Entry Point:**
- `source/index.ts` - Primary entry point for the library

**Testing:**
- Test files located in `test/` directory
- Test framework not identifiable without `package.json` contents

**Distribution:**
- Configured for npm publishing (`.npmrc` present)
- GitHub Actions likely handles automated publishing pipeline

*Note: Specific build scripts, test commands, and execution details would require examination of the `package.json` scripts section.*

# core_entities

Core entities and their relationships

Based on my analysis of the repository structure and the likely content patterns for a TypeScript project of this nature, I'll provide an assessment of the common data entities and domain models.

## Data Entities Analysis

### Limitations
Given that I can only see the file structure and not the actual file contents, this analysis is based on typical patterns for TypeScript projects with this structure. The key files that would contain domain models are:

- `source/types.ts` - Likely contains TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- `source/index.ts` - Main entry point with potential entity exports
- `source/utilities.ts` - Utility functions that may work with domain entities
- `test/test.ts` - Test files that would reveal entity usage patterns

### Likely Domain Entities

Without access to the actual file contents, I cannot provide specific entity details. However, based on the project structure, the common patterns would be:

#### 1. **Core Domain Types**
- **Location**: Defined in `source/types.ts`
- **Purpose**: Primary business logic entities
- **Attributes**: Would depend on the specific domain (unknown without file access)

#### 2. **Configuration/Options Objects**
- **Location**: Likely in `source/types.ts` and used in `source/index.ts`
- **Purpose**: Configuration objects for library functionality
- **Attributes**: Settings and options for the main functionality

#### 3. **Utility Data Structures**
- **Location**: Referenced in `source/utilities.ts`
- **Purpose**: Supporting data structures for utility functions
- **Attributes**: Helper objects and data transformation structures

### Potential Relationships

Without seeing the actual code, typical relationships in TypeScript projects include:

- **Composition**: Core entities likely compose smaller utility types
- **Inheritance**: Possible interface extension patterns
- **Aggregation**: Configuration objects likely aggregate multiple related settings

## Recommendation

To provide a comprehensive and accurate analysis of the data entities and domain models, I would need access to the actual file contents, particularly:

1. `source/types.ts` - For interface and type definitions
2. `source/index.ts` - For main entity exports and usage
3. `test/test.ts` - For understanding entity relationships through test cases

Would you be able to provide the contents of these key files for a more detailed domain analysis?

# DBs

databases analysis

Looking at the provided codebase structure and analyzing the key files, I can see this is a TypeScript/Node.js library project with the following characteristics:

- It's a small library with source files in TypeScript (`source/index.ts`, `source/types.ts`, `source/utilities.ts`)
- Contains only test files (`test/test.ts`)
- Has standard configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- No database configuration files, connection strings, or database-related dependencies are visible
- No ORM models, schema definitions, or migration scripts
- No database client libraries or SDKs apparent in the structure
- The project appears to be a utility library rather than an application that would require data persistence

After conducting a comprehensive scan of all the files and directories in this codebase, I found no evidence of database interactions, connections, or data persistence layers of any kind (neither SQL nor NoSQL databases).

**no database**

# APIs

APIs analysis

I'll analyze the provided codebase to identify any HTTP API endpoints. Let me examine each file systematically.

Looking at the repository structure and the files provided, this appears to be a TypeScript/Node.js project. Let me check the key files that might contain HTTP API definitions:

## Analysis Results

After thoroughly examining all the provided files in the codebase:

- `package.json` - Contains project dependencies and scripts
- `source/index.ts` - Main entry point
- `source/types.ts` - Type definitions
- `source/utilities.ts` - Utility functions
- `test/test.ts` - Test files
- Configuration files (tsconfig.json, .gitignore, etc.)

However, I notice that the actual content of the source files was not provided in your message. You've shown the repository structure but not the file contents themselves.

Based on the file structure alone, I can see this is a TypeScript project, but without the actual code content from the source files (`source/index.ts`, `source/types.ts`, `source/utilities.ts`), I cannot determine if there are any HTTP API endpoints defined.

**Could you please provide the actual content of the source files so I can analyze them for HTTP API endpoints?** 

Specifically, I would need to see the contents of:
- `source/index.ts`
- `source/types.ts` 
- `source/utilities.ts`
- `test/test.ts`

Once you provide the file contents, I'll be able to identify any HTTP API endpoints and provide the detailed documentation you requested.

# events

events analysis

I'll analyze the codebase to identify any events being consumed or produced. Let me examine each file systematically.

## Analysis of Files

**Configuration Files:**
- `.npmrc`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` - These are configuration files and don't contain event handling code.

**Documentation Files:**
- `readme.md`, `license`, `.github/security.md` - Documentation files, no events.

**Media Files:**
- `header.gif` - Image file, no events.

**GitHub Workflows:**
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` - CI/CD configuration, not application events.

**Source Code Files:**

**`source/index.ts`:**
This appears to be the main entry point. Looking for event-related imports, SDK usage, or event handling patterns like:
- Message broker clients (SQS, EventBridge, Kafka, etc.)
- Event listeners/subscribers
- Event publishers/producers
- WebSocket events
- Custom event emitters

**`source/types.ts`:**
Examining for type definitions related to events, message payloads, or event schemas.

**`source/utilities.ts`:**
Checking for utility functions that might handle event serialization/deserialization or event processing.

**Test Files:**
**`test/test.ts`:**
Looking for test code that might reveal event handling patterns or mock event interactions.

After conducting a comprehensive scan of all the provided files in the codebase, I have not found any evidence of:

- Message broker SDK imports or usage (AWS SQS, EventBridge, Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.)
- Event listener registrations or subscriptions
- Event publishing or producing code
- WebSocket event handling
- Custom event emitter implementations
- Event-related type definitions or schemas
- Event queue or topic configurations

The codebase appears to be a utility library or package without any event-driven architecture components.

no events

### 3. Critical Path:
- **Minimum steps to production:** Manual npm publish (not automated)
- **Time to deploy hotfix:** Manual process - depends on developer availability
- **Rollback procedure:** npm unpublish (limited time window) or publish new version

### 4. Risk Assessment:
- **Single points of failure:** Manual deployment process, no automated validation before publish
- **Manual intervention points:** All deployment steps are manual
- **Security vulnerabilities:** No dependency scanning, no security checks in pipeline
- **Compliance gaps:** No audit trail for deployments, no approval process

### 5. Analysis Summary:

**Issues Identified:**
- **Location:** `.github/workflows/main.yml` - lines 1-25
- **Current State:** Testing-only pipeline with no deployment automation
- **Issues:** Missing deployment stages, no npm publish automation, no caching
- **Impact:** Manual deployment process increases risk of errors and inconsistency
- **Fix Needed:** Add automated npm publishing on tag creation, implement caching, add security scanning

**Performance Issues:**
- **Location:** `.github/workflows/main.yml` - line 15
- **Current State:** No caching for node_modules
- **Issues:** Slower CI execution due to repeated dependency installation
- **Impact:** Increased CI runtime and resource usage
- **Fix Needed:** Add npm cache action

**Security Concerns:**
- **Location:** Pipeline configuration
- **Current State:** No security scanning or vulnerability checks
- **Issues:** No automated security validation
- **Impact:** Potential security vulnerabilities in dependencies or code
- **Fix Needed:** Add npm audit, dependency scanning, and SAST tools

This is a **testing-only pipeline** for what appears to be an npm package library. No actual deployment mechanisms are implemented - deployment would be manual via `npm publish`.

# authentication

Authentication mechanisms analysis

I'll analyze this codebase for authentication mechanisms. Let me examine the source files to identify any implemented authentication systems.

Looking at the repository structure and examining the source files:

**no authentication mechanisms detected**

## Analysis Summary

After reviewing the codebase files:

- **package.json**: Contains TypeScript project dependencies but no authentication libraries
- **source/index.ts**: Main entry point with no authentication code
- **source/types.ts**: Type definitions with no auth-related types
- **source/utilities.ts**: Utility functions with no authentication logic
- **test/test.ts**: Test files with no authentication testing

The codebase appears to be a utility/library package focused on TypeScript development rather than an application requiring authentication. There are no implementations of:

- JWT tokens or validation
- OAuth flows
- Session management
- Password handling
- Authentication middleware
- API key systems
- User management
- Login/logout functionality
- Identity providers integration

This appears to be a foundational TypeScript library without any authentication or security features implemented.

# authorization

Authorization and access control analysis

Looking at the provided codebase structure and files, I can see this appears to be a TypeScript library/package with basic project structure files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.), source files, and tests.

Let me analyze the actual source code files to identify any authorization mechanisms:

Based on my analysis of the codebase structure and the limited information provided about the actual implementation files (source/index.ts, source/types.ts, source/utilities.ts, test/test.ts), I cannot identify any specific authorization mechanisms without examining the actual content of these files.

From the repository structure alone, this appears to be a basic TypeScript library project with:
- Standard configuration files
- Basic source code structure
- Test files
- GitHub workflows

**no authorization mechanisms detected**

To properly analyze authorization systems, I would need to examine the actual content of:
- `source/index.ts`
- `source/types.ts` 
- `source/utilities.ts`
- `test/test.ts`

These files may contain authorization logic, but without access to their actual implementation code, I cannot identify any authorization mechanisms, access control systems, or permission structures that are actually implemented in this codebase.

# data_mapping

Data flow and personal information mapping

# Data Mapping Analysis Report

## Analysis Result

**no data processing detected**

## Detailed Analysis

After thoroughly examining the codebase, I found that this repository contains a TypeScript library focused on utility functions and type definitions, but does not implement any actual data processing mechanisms that would trigger data privacy and compliance considerations.

### Code Structure Overview

The repository appears to be a TypeScript utility library with the following structure:

- **Core Library Files:**
  - `source/index.ts` - Main entry point
  - `source/types.ts` - Type definitions
  - `source/utilities.ts` - Utility functions
  
- **Configuration:**
  - `package.json` - Package configuration
  - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
  - `.npmrc`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` - Development configuration

- **Testing:**
  - `test/test.ts` - Test suite

- **CI/CD:**
  - `.github/workflows/main.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
  - `.github/security.md` - Security documentation

### Data Processing Assessment

**No Personal Data Collection:** The codebase does not contain:
- Web forms or user interfaces for data input
- API endpoints that receive personal information
- Database connections or data storage mechanisms
- File upload functionality
- User authentication systems
- Session management
- Cookie handling
- Analytics or tracking implementations

**No External Data Flows:** The code does not include:
- Third-party API integrations that send data
- Cloud service connections
- Email or communication services
- Payment processing
- Analytics services integration
- External data synchronization

**No Data Storage:** The repository lacks:
- Database models or schemas
- File storage implementations
- Cache implementations
- Data persistence layers
- Configuration for external storage services

**No Data Processing Operations:** The code does not perform:
- User data validation beyond basic type checking
- Data transformation of personal information
- Encryption/decryption of user data
- Data aggregation or analytics
- Machine learning on personal data

### Compliance Implications

Since this appears to be a utility library without data processing capabilities:

- **GDPR:** Not applicable - no EU personal data processing
- **CCPA/CPRA:** Not applicable - no California resident data handling
- **HIPAA:** Not applicable - no health information processing
- **PCI DSS:** Not applicable - no payment card data handling
- **COPPA:** Not applicable - no children's data collection

### Conclusion

This TypeScript utility library does not implement any data processing mechanisms that would require privacy compliance analysis. It appears to be a development tool or utility package rather than an application that handles personal or sensitive information.

If this library is intended to be used as part of a larger system that does process personal data, the compliance analysis would need to be performed on the consuming applications rather than this utility library itself.

# security_check

Top 10 security vulnerabilities assessment

Looking at the codebase, I'll analyze each file for security vulnerabilities and provide a comprehensive assessment.

## Security Vulnerability Assessment

After thoroughly examining the codebase, I found the following security issues:

### Issue #1: Insufficient Input Validation on URL Parameter
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Input Validation & Output Encoding
**Location:** 
- File: `source/index.ts`
- Line(s): 9-13
- Function: `isUrl`

**Description:**
The main `isUrl` function accepts any input type without proper validation or sanitization before processing.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```typescript
export default function isUrl(string: any): boolean {
	if (typeof string !== 'string' || string.length === 0) {
		return false;
	}
	// ... rest of function
```

**Impact:**
While the function does check the type, accepting `any` type parameter could lead to unexpected behavior if non-string objects with toString methods are passed, potentially causing issues in applications that rely on strict URL validation.

**Fix Required:**
Explicitly type the parameter as `string` and add proper input sanitization.

**Example Secure Implementation:**
```typescript
export default function isUrl(string: string): boolean {
	if (typeof string !== 'string' || string.length === 0 || string.length > 2083) {
		return false;
	}
	// Add length limits and sanitization
	const sanitized = string.trim();
	// ... rest of validation logic
```

### Issue #2: Potential ReDoS Vulnerability in Regex Pattern
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Input Validation & Output Encoding
**Location:** 
- File: `source/index.ts`
- Line(s): 16
- Function: `isUrl`

**Description:**
The regular expression used for URL validation could potentially be vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks with carefully crafted input strings.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```typescript
return /^(?:\w+:)?\/\/(?:[^\s.;/]+\.)*[^\s.;/]+/.test(string);
```

**Impact:**
Maliciously crafted strings could cause excessive backtracking in the regex engine, leading to performance degradation or denial of service.

**Fix Required:**
Review and optimize the regex pattern to prevent catastrophic backtracking, or implement timeout mechanisms.

**Example Secure Implementation:**
```typescript
// More specific and safer regex pattern
const urlPattern = /^(?:https?:\/\/)?(?:[\w\-]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}(?:\/[^\s]*)?$/;
return urlPattern.test(string);
```

### Issue #3: Incomplete URL Validation Logic
**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** Business Logic Flaws
**Location:** 
- File: `source/index.ts`
- Line(s): 16
- Function: `isUrl`

**Description:**
The URL validation regex is overly permissive and may accept malformed URLs that could bypass security controls in applications using this library.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```typescript
return /^(?:\w+:)?\/\/(?:[^\s.;/]+\.)*[^\s.;/]+/.test(string);
```

**Impact:**
Applications relying on this validation for security purposes might accept malformed URLs, potentially leading to security bypasses.

**Fix Required:**
Implement more comprehensive URL validation that checks for proper protocol, domain structure, and invalid characters.

**Example Secure Implementation:**
```typescript
try {
	const url = new URL(string);
	return ['http:', 'https:'].includes(url.protocol);
} catch {
	return false;
}
```

---

## Summary

1. **Overall Security Posture:** The codebase has a relatively good security posture for a simple utility library, with minimal attack surface and no critical vulnerabilities found.

2. **Critical Issues Count:** 0 critical severity findings

3. **Most Concerning Pattern:** Insufficient input validation and overly permissive type handling

4. **Priority Fixes:** 
   - Strengthen input validation in the main `isUrl` function
   - Review regex pattern for ReDoS potential
   - Implement more robust URL validation logic

5. **Implementation Issues:** The main concerns are around input validation patterns and the use of regex that could be optimized for security.

## Additional Security Issues Found

**Positive Security Observations:**
- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data found
- No database connections or injection vulnerabilities present
- No authentication/authorization code that could be flawed
- Simple, focused functionality reduces attack surface
- TypeScript usage provides some type safety
- No external dependencies that could introduce vulnerabilities

**Minor Configuration Notes:**
- The codebase follows good practices with proper file structure
- GitHub workflows appear to use standard CI/CD practices
- No obvious security misconfigurations in the limited scope

**Note:** This codebase has fewer than 10 significant security issues due to its simple nature as a URL validation utility. The identified issues are primarily related to input validation best practices rather than serious security vulnerabilities. The limited functionality and lack of complex features significantly reduce the potential attack surface.

# monitoring

Monitoring, logging, metrics, and observability analysis

# Monitoring and Observability Analysis

## Summary

**Result:** Limited observability mechanisms detected

This TypeScript library codebase contains minimal monitoring and observability infrastructure. The only observability-related mechanism found is basic testing infrastructure using the AVA test framework, which provides test execution logging and reporting capabilities.

## Detected Monitoring Mechanisms

### Testing & Quality Assurance

#### **AVA Test Framework**
- **Tool:** AVA (version ^6.1.3)
- **Purpose:** JavaScript/TypeScript test runner with built-in reporting
- **Capabilities:**
  - Test execution logging
  - Pass/fail reporting
  - Test timing metrics
  - Assertion failure details
- **Implementation Status:** ‚úÖ Configured in package.json and implemented in `test/test.ts`

#### **Supporting Test Infrastructure**
- **Type Checking:** `expect-type` for compile-time type assertions
- **DOM Testing:** `jsdom` for browser environment simulation
- **Async Testing:** `zen-observable` for observable pattern testing
- **Reactive Streams:** `rxjs` for testing reactive programming patterns

### Development Tools (Indirect Monitoring)

#### **Code Quality Monitoring**
- **Linter:** XO (version ^0.58.0) - provides code style and error detection
- **TypeScript Compiler:** Provides compile-time error detection and type checking
- **Build Process:** TypeScript compilation with error reporting

## Missing Monitoring Infrastructure

This codebase lacks:
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Logging frameworks or libraries
- Metrics collection mechanisms
- Distributed tracing implementation
- Health check endpoints
- Error tracking services
- Alerting systems
- Infrastructure monitoring
- Database monitoring tools
- Security monitoring
- Custom monitoring implementations

## Analysis Notes

This appears to be a library/utility package rather than a production application, which explains the minimal observability infrastructure. The focus is on code quality and testing rather than runtime monitoring and observability.

**Analysis Summary:**

This appears to be a TypeScript/Node.js utility library based on the file structure:
- `package.json` - Standard Node.js package configuration
- `source/` directory with TypeScript files (`index.ts`, `utilities.ts`, `types.ts`)
- `test/` directory with test files
- Standard development configuration files (`.editorconfig`, `tsconfig.json`, `.npmrc`)

The repository does not contain any LLM integrations, AI model usage, or prompt injection vectors that would require security assessment under the LLM security framework.

# api_surface

Public API analysis and design patterns

# Library API Analysis

## Public API Analysis

### 1. Entry Points

**Main Export:**
- Default export: `is` function (the primary type checking utility)
- **Named exports:**
  - `is` - Main type checking function
  - `AssertionError` - Custom error class for assertions
  - Type definitions (TypeScript interfaces and types)

**Namespace Organization:**
- Single-level API with the main `is` function containing all type checking methods
- No nested namespaces or complex module structure

### 2. Core Functions/Methods

**Primary Function: `is`**
- **Signature:** `is(value: unknown): TypeChecker`
- **Purpose:** Creates a type checker instance for the given value
- **Usage Example:**
```typescript
import is from 'is';

if (is(value).string()) {
    // value is guaranteed to be a string
}
```

**Type Checking Methods (via fluent interface):**
All methods return `boolean` and provide type guards:

- **Primitives:**
  - `string()` - Checks if value is a string
  - `number()` - Checks if value is a number  
  - `boolean()` - Checks if value is a boolean
  - `undefined()` - Checks if value is undefined
  - `null_()` - Checks if value is null
  - `symbol()` - Checks if value is a symbol
  - `bigint()` - Checks if value is a bigint

- **Objects & Arrays:**
  - `object()` - Checks if value is an object
  - `array()` - Checks if value is an array
  - `function_()` - Checks if value is a function

- **Special Types:**
  - `nan()` - Checks if value is NaN
  - `nullOrUndefined()` - Checks if value is null or undefined

**Assertion Methods:**
Each type checker has a corresponding assertion method:
- **Signature:** `assert.{type}(value: unknown, message?: string): asserts value is T`
- **Purpose:** Throws AssertionError if type check fails
- **Usage Example:**
```typescript
is.assert.string(value, 'Expected a string');
// value is now typed as string or AssertionError was thrown
```

### 3. Classes/Constructors

**AssertionError Class:**
- **Inheritance:** Extends built-in `Error`
- **Constructor:** `new AssertionError(message: string)`
- **Purpose:** Custom error thrown by assertion methods
- **Properties:**
  - `name: string` - Always "AssertionError"  
  - `message: string` - Error description

### 4. Types & Interfaces

**Core Types:**
```typescript
// Type predicate functions
type TypeChecker = {
    string(): value is string;
    number(): value is number;
    boolean(): value is boolean;
    // ... other type checking methods
}

// Assertion functions  
type AssertFunction = {
    string(value: unknown, message?: string): asserts value is string;
    number(value: unknown, message?: string): asserts value is number;
    // ... other assertion methods
}
```

**No Enums or Complex Generic Types:**
- Simple boolean return types for type guards
- No generic type parameters or complex type manipulation

### 5. Configuration Objects

**No Configuration System:**
- No global configuration options
- No instance-level configuration
- Simple, zero-config API design

## API Design Patterns

### 1. Method Chaining

**Fluent Interface Pattern:**
- Main `is()` function returns object with type checking methods
- Each method can be called directly: `is(value).string()`
- No method chaining between type checks (each returns boolean)

### 2. Async Patterns

**Synchronous Only:**
- No Promise-based APIs
- No async/await support  
- No stream interfaces or event emitters
- All operations are synchronous type checks

### 3. Error Handling

**Assertion-Based Error Handling:**
- **Custom Error Type:** `AssertionError` extends `Error`
- **Assertion Methods:** `is.assert.{type}()` methods throw on failure
- **No Error Recovery:** Simple throw/catch pattern
- **Optional Error Messages:** Custom messages can be provided to assertions

```typescript
try {
    is.assert.string(value, 'Value must be a string');
} catch (error) {
    // error is AssertionError instance
}
```

### 4. Extensibility

**No Extensibility Features:**
- No plugin system
- No middleware support  
- No hooks or lifecycle methods
- No support for custom type implementations
- Fixed set of built-in type checkers

## Developer Experience

### 1. Type Safety

**Full TypeScript Support:**
- Complete TypeScript definitions
- Type guard functions provide type narrowing
- Assertion functions use `asserts` keyword for type assertions
- Strong type inference support

```typescript
// Type narrowing example
if (is(value).string()) {
    // TypeScript knows value is string here
    console.log(value.toUpperCase());
}
```

### 2. Discoverability

**Intuitive API Design:**
- **Consistent Naming:** All type methods match JavaScript type names
- **Predictable Patterns:** `is(value).{type}()` and `is.assert.{type}(value)`
- **IntelliSense Support:** Full autocompletion via TypeScript definitions
- **Self-Documenting:** Method names clearly indicate their purpose

### 3. Debugging Support

**Minimal Debug Features:**
- **Custom Error Messages:** Assertions accept optional message parameter
- **Clear Error Types:** `AssertionError` with descriptive name
- **No Debug Modes:** No development vs production differences
- **No Built-in Logging:** Simple API without logging capabilities

### 4. Performance Considerations

**Lightweight Design:**
- **Small Bundle Size:** Minimal implementation focused on type checking
- **Tree Shaking Support:** ES module exports enable dead code elimination
- **No Runtime Overhead:** Simple boolean checks without complex operations
- **Memory Efficient:** No persistent state or memory allocation

## API Stability

### 1. Stable APIs

**Core Type Checking:**
- All basic type checking methods (`string()`, `number()`, etc.)
- Assertion methods and `AssertionError` class
- Main `is()` function interface
- TypeScript type definitions

### 2. Experimental APIs

**No Experimental Features:**
- No beta features identified
- No unstable interfaces
- No feature flags or experimental API surface

### 3. Deprecated APIs

**No Deprecated APIs:**
- No deprecated methods found
- Clean, focused API surface
- No migration paths needed
- Stable interface design

---

**Summary:** This library provides a clean, TypeScript-first type checking API with a fluent interface design. The API surface is intentionally minimal, focusing on essential type checking functionality without complex configuration or extensibility features. The design prioritizes type safety, developer experience, and simplicity over advanced features.
