if you are about to create a new report in markdown, or generate any chart as a reponse to a user query about this repository, always place the results in a folder in the root of this repository with this pattern: 
[root]/reports/[query-title-up-to-5-words]/[generated-files-go-here]

also, save the query that generated the report at the top section of the report under "prompt that generated this report:" (save all the history of the prompts so people can repeat them later)

report date shoudl be generated using a command line call always.
