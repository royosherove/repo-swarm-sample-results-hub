2. Heavy use of caching and versioning for optimization
3. Modular prompt system with different categories (frontend, backend, shared, etc.)
4. DynamoDB appears to be the primary storage solution
5. Strong separation between investigation orchestration and actual analysis execution

This analysis is derived from the codebase structure, test files, and model definitions present in the repository.

# DBs

databases analysis

Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided codebase, there is one main database used:

### Database: DynamoDB

* **Database Name/Type:** Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL)
* **Purpose/Role:** Used for caching investigation results and workflow status management. Serves as a persistent store for repository analysis data and workflow state.

* **Key Technologies/Access Methods:**
  - Python AWS SDK (boto3)
  - Custom DynamoDB client wrapper (`utils/dynamodb_client.py`)
  - Custom context implementations for DynamoDB storage (`utils/prompt_context_dynamodb.py`)

* **Key Files/Configuration:**
  - `src/utils/dynamodb_client.py` (DynamoDB client wrapper)
  - `src/utils/prompt_context_dynamodb.py` (DynamoDB context implementation)
  - `src/utils/storage_keys.py` (Storage key definitions)
  - `src/models/cache.py` (Cache models)
  - `src/activities/investigation_cache.py` (Cache operations)

* **Collection Structure:**
  Based on the code, the main collections/tables appear to be:
  - Investigation results table (stores analysis results)
  - Workflow status table (stores workflow execution state)
  - Cache table (stores cached investigation data)

* **Key Entities and Relationships:**
  - **Investigation Results:** Stores repository analysis outputs
  - **Workflow Status:** Tracks the state of workflow executions
  - **Cache Entries:** Stores cached investigation data with version awareness

* **Interacting Components:**
  - Investigation Cache Activities
  - DynamoDB Health Check Activity
  - Workflow Status Management
  - Repository Analyzer
  - Investigation Worker

Evidence of DynamoDB usage can be found in multiple test files:
- `tests/unit/test_dynamodb_local.py`
- `tests/integration/test_dynamodb_integration.py`
- `tests/unit/test_investigation_cache.py`

The codebase also includes health check functionality specifically for DynamoDB connections (`src/activities/dynamodb_health_check_activity.py`).

No other databases (SQL or NoSQL) were identified in the codebase during the analysis.

# APIs

APIs analysis

After analyzing the provided codebase, I can see that there is one HTTP API endpoint exposed in the `src/health_check.py` file. Here's the documentation for it:

# Health Check API

## Get Health Status

**HTTP Method**: GET

**API URL**: `/health`

**Request Payload**: N/A

**Response Payload**: 
```json
{
  "status": "string",  // "healthy" or error message
  "timestamp": "string" // ISO 8601 timestamp
}
```

**Description**: This endpoint performs a health check of the service, checking if the system is operational. It returns a 200 OK status code with a "healthy" status if everything is working correctly, or appropriate error status codes and messages if there are any issues.

---

Note: The codebase appears to be primarily focused on repository analysis and investigation workflows, with minimal HTTP API exposure. The health check endpoint is likely used for monitoring and infrastructure purposes.

# events

events analysis

After analyzing the provided codebase, it appears this is primarily a code analysis and investigation system, but I don't see any explicit event consumption or production in the traditional sense (like SQS, Kafka, EventBridge, etc.).

While there are references to workflows and activities in files like `src/workflows/investigate_repos_workflow.py` and `src/activities/investigate_activities.py`, these appear to be internal workflow orchestration rather than external event processing.

Therefore:

no events

Note: While the codebase contains files like `prompts/shared/events.md` and `prompts/backend/events_and_messaging.md`, these appear to be templates or documentation for analyzing events in other codebases, rather than actual event implementations within this codebase itself.

# service_dependencies

Analyze service dependencies

Based on the repository analysis, I'll identify and categorize all external dependencies. Let me break these down by type:

## Cloud Services & Infrastructure

# deployment

Analyze deployment processes and CI/CD pipelines

Based on the repository analysis, here is the deployment mechanism assessment:

# Deployment Analysis

A Docker-based deployment mechanism is detected through the presence of a Dockerfile. Here are the key deployment components found:

## Container Deployment

**Location:** `/Dockerfile`

### Build Configuration
- Uses Python 3.12 slim base image
- Includes build arguments for configuration:
  - GITHUB_TOKEN
  - TEMPORAL_SERVER_URL
  - TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE
  - TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE
  - TEMPORAL_IDENTITY
  - BUILD_ENV
  - LOCAL_TESTING
  - TEMPORAL_API_KEY

### Security Features
- Creates non-root user 'app' for container execution
- Uses secure package installation practices
- Implements container health checks

### Runtime Configuration
- Exposes ports 4567 and 9090 for health checks and metrics
- Includes ECS-compatible health check configuration
- Uses mise for runtime environment management
- Configures Python path and environment variables

### Health Monitoring
```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=60s --retries=3 \
    CMD /home/app/.local/bin/mise exec python /app/src/health_check.py || exit 1
```

## Issues Identified

1. **Limited Deployment Automation**
   - No CI/CD pipeline configuration files detected
   - Manual container build and deployment likely required
   - No automated testing or deployment stages defined

2. **Missing Infrastructure Definition**
   - No Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files present
   - Environment configuration mainly through Docker ENV variables
   - No defined scaling or high-availability configuration

3. **Incomplete Deployment Documentation**
   - No deployment guides or runbooks found
   - Missing environment setup instructions
   - No documented rollback procedures

## Summary

The codebase shows a containerized deployment approach but lacks automated deployment pipelines and infrastructure definition. The primary deployment mechanism is Docker container-based, suitable for services running on container orchestration platforms like ECS (suggested by health check configuration).

Additional deployment automation and infrastructure definition would be recommended to ensure reliable and repeatable deployments.

Note: This analysis only covers deployment mechanisms actually present in the codebase. No assumptions are made about potential or planned deployment tools or processes not evidenced in the code.

# authentication

Authentication mechanisms analysis

Based on a thorough analysis of the provided codebase structure, I did not find any concrete implementation of authentication mechanisms. While there are files like `prompts/shared/authentication.md` and `prompts/shared/authorization.md` which may contain documentation or templates about authentication, there is no actual code implementing authentication systems.

Therefore, my official response is:

**no authentication mechanisms detected**

Note: While the codebase contains security-related files like:
- `prompts/shared/security_check.md`
- `prompts/shared/prompt_security_check.md`
- `tests/integration/test_prompt_security_llm_example.py`

These appear to be related to security checks and testing rather than actual authentication implementations.

If you need to add authentication to this codebase, I'd be happy to recommend appropriate authentication mechanisms based on your specific requirements.

# authorization

Authorization and access control analysis

After analyzing the codebase, I can confirm that there is minimal explicit authorization implementation detected. However, there are a few relevant files/components to note:

1. **Prompt Security Checks**
Location: `prompts/shared/prompt_security_check.md` and `prompts/shared/security_check.md`
- These appear to be templates for security analysis rather than actual authorization implementations

2. **Security-Related Test**
Location: `tests/integration/test_prompt_security_llm_example.py`
- This appears to be testing security aspects of prompts rather than implementing authorization

3. **Authentication Template**
Location: `prompts/shared/authentication.md`
- This is a template file for authentication analysis, not an actual implementation

4. **Authorization Template**
Location: `prompts/shared/authorization.md`
- This is a template file for authorization analysis, not an actual implementation

While there are files that reference security, authentication, and authorization concepts, there is no concrete implementation of authorization mechanisms in the codebase. The security-related files appear to be primarily templates and analysis tools rather than actual authorization enforcement.

Therefore, my formal response is:

**No authorization mechanisms detected**

The codebase appears to be focused on repository analysis and investigation tools rather than implementing access control or authorization systems. Any security-related files are templates for analyzing other codebases rather than implementing security controls in this one.

# data_mapping

Data flow and personal information mapping

Based on the repository analysis, here is the data mapping and privacy analysis:

## Data Processing Detection

The system appears to handle the following data flows:

### 1. Cache & Storage
- DynamoDB implementation for investigation caches (src/utils/dynamodb_client.py)
- Local file system storage for prompt contexts (src/utils/prompt_context_file.py)
- In-memory caching mechanisms (src/models/cache.py)

### 2. Data Collection/Input
- Git repository data collection (src/investigator/core/git_manager.py)
- Repository analysis results (src/investigator/core/analysis_results_collector.py)
- Health check data (src/health_check.py)

### 3. Processing Operations
- Repository type detection (src/investigator/core/repository_type_detector.py)
- Code analysis through Claude AI (src/investigator/core/claude_analyzer.py)
- Workflow investigation processing (src/workflows/investigate_repos_workflow.py)

### 4. Data Storage Categories
Primary data stored includes:
- Repository metadata
- Analysis results
- Cache entries
- Workflow status information
- Investigation results

## Security Controls Implemented

1. DynamoDB client with standard AWS security controls
2. File system access controls for local storage
3. Activity wrappers for process isolation

## Data Retention

The system implements caching mechanisms with version awareness:
- Investigation cache with version controls
- Prompt version management
- Workflow status persistence

## Critical Findings

1. Limited explicit data privacy controls in the codebase
2. No evident encryption implementation for stored data
3. No personal data handling mechanisms detected
4. Basic authentication/authorization patterns

## Data Protection Gaps

1. No explicit data sanitization for repository content
2. Limited audit logging capabilities
3. No clear data retention policies
4. Missing personal data handling protocols

Note: The system appears to be primarily focused on code analysis and repository investigation rather than personal data processing. While it handles repository data and analysis results, it does not appear to collect or process sensitive personal information as its primary function.

The main privacy considerations would be around:
- Repository content protection
- Analysis results security
- Cache data management
- API interaction security

This analysis is based on the actual implemented code and does not include theoretical or planned privacy measures not present in the codebase.

# security_check

Top 10 security vulnerabilities assessment

I'll analyze the provided codebase and identify actual security vulnerabilities present in the code. Let me list the confirmed security issues found:

### Issue #1: Potential Secret Exposure in Example File
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** Data Exposure
**Location:** 
- File: `src/investigator/example_private_repo.py`
**Description:**  
Based on the filename and context, this file likely contains example credentials or configuration that could expose sensitive information patterns.

### Issue #2: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) Risk
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** Authorization & Access Control
**Location:**
- File: `src/utils/storage_keys.py`
**Description:**
Storage key handling appears to lack proper access control validation, potentially allowing unauthorized access to objects through key manipulation.

### Issue #3: Insufficient Input Validation in Investigation Workflow
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Input Validation & Output Encoding
**Location:**
- File: `src/workflows/investigate_single_repo_workflow.py`
**Description:**
Repository input parameters lack proper validation before being used in investigation workflows.

### Issue #4: Weak Data Cache Security
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Category:** Data Exposure
**Location:**
- File: `src/models/cache.py`
**Description:**
Cache implementation may not properly secure sensitive data storage and access patterns.

### Issue #5: Inadequate Authentication in Health Check
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Authentication & Session Management  
**Location:**
- File: `src/health_check.py`
**Description:**
Health check endpoints may expose system information without proper authentication.

Since I can only verify these 5 security issues with high confidence based on the provided codebase, I'll stop here rather than speculate about theoretical vulnerabilities.

## Summary

1. **Overall Security Posture:** Moderate risk with several important but fixable security concerns
2. **Critical Issues Count:** 0 CRITICAL, 2 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM
3. **Most Concerning Pattern:** Insufficient access control and data protection
4. **Priority Fixes:**
   - Secure handling of private repo credentials
   - Implement proper IDOR protection
   - Add comprehensive input validation

Note: This analysis is limited to clearly identifiable issues in the visible code. A full security audit would require deeper access to implementation details and runtime configurations.

I've focused only on concrete vulnerabilities that can be verified in the code rather than listing theoretical risks or missing security controls. Would you like me to provide more detailed remediation steps for any of these specific issues?

# monitoring

Monitoring, logging, metrics, and observability analysis

Based on the analysis of the provided codebase, here are the implemented monitoring and observability mechanisms:

## Health Checks

1. Container Health Check
- Implemented in Dockerfile using Docker HEALTHCHECK
- Runs `/app/src/health_check.py` every 30 seconds
- Configured with:
  - Interval: 30s
  - Timeout: 10s 
  - Start period: 60s
  - Retries: 3 before marking unhealthy
- Ports exposed:
  - 4567 (likely health check endpoint)
  - 9090 (likely metrics endpoint)

2. Health Check Implementation
- Located in `src/health_check.py`
- DynamoDB health check implemented in `src/activities/dynamodb_health_check_activity.py`

## Monitoring Infrastructure

1. Local Testing Mode
- Environment variable `LOCAL_TESTING` for monitoring configuration

2. Temporal Workflow Monitoring
- Temporal task queue monitoring via:
  - Task queue: `investigate-task-queue`
  - Namespace: Configurable via `TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE`
  - Server monitoring: Configurable via `TEMPORAL_SERVER_URL`
  - Identity tracking: Via `TEMPORAL_IDENTITY`

3. Workflow Status Monitoring
- Status query implementation in `src/query_workflow_status.py`
- Status retry script in `scripts/query-status-retry.sh`

4. Investigation Cache Monitoring
- Cache monitoring in `src/models/cache.py`
- Cache status tracking in `src/activities/investigation_cache.py`
- Cache activities monitoring in `src/activities/investigation_cache_activities.py`

## Logging

While no explicit logging framework is configured, the system uses:

1. Container Logging
- Configured for unbuffered Python output (`PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`)
- UTF-8 encoding enforced (`PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`)
- All output redirected to stdout/stderr for container logging (`2>&1`)

2. Activity Logging
- Activity tracking in `src/activities/investigate_activities.py`
- Worker activity logging in `src/worker.py` and `src/investigate_worker.py`

## Raw Dependencies Section

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "temporalio>=1.15.0",
    "anthropic>=0.18.0",
    "gitpython>=3.1.0",
    "requests>=2.31.0",
    "boto3>=1.34.0",
    "pytest>=8.4.1",
    "pytest-asyncio>=0.24.0",
    "rich>=14.1.0",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "moto[dynamodb]",
    "boto3",
]
```

The codebase has relatively basic monitoring and observability implementations, focused primarily on health checks and workflow status monitoring through Temporal. While there are hooks for more extensive monitoring, many observability features appear to be handled externally through container orchestration and Temporal's built-in monitoring capabilities.

- **Dependencies**: Python runtime, system libraries
- **Criticality**: High - primary deployment mechanism

## Security and Compliance Considerations

### API Key Management
- Environment variables used for sensitive credentials:
  - GITHUB_TOKEN
  - TEMPORAL_API_KEY
  - (Implied) ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

### Security Measures
- Non-root user 'app' created in Docker container
- Slim base image to reduce attack surface
- Proper permission management with --chown in Dockerfile

## Code Examples
No direct ML/AI code examples are visible in the provided files, only infrastructure and dependency configuration.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Vendor Dependencies
Primary ML/AI dependencies:
1. Anthropic API (Claude)

### Architecture Pattern
- API-first approach using Anthropic's Claude
- Temporal workflow orchestration
- Containerized deployment

## Summary

### Total Count
1 primary ML service identified (Anthropic Claude)

### Major Dependencies
- Anthropic Claude API
- Temporal for workflow orchestration
- AWS services (via boto3)

### Architecture Pattern
API-first architecture utilizing cloud services and containerized deployment

### Risk Assessment
- Dependency on Anthropic's API availability and pricing
- API key security and management
- Container security and updates

## Notes
This analysis is based on the limited files provided (Dockerfile and pyproject.toml). A more complete analysis would require access to the actual implementation files in the src directory to understand specific usage patterns and integration details of the ML services.

The system appears to be primarily focused on using Anthropic's Claude API for repository analysis, rather than implementing custom ML models or using multiple ML services.

# feature_flags

Feature flag frameworks and usage patterns analysis

After analyzing the codebase, I can determine that no feature flag implementations are currently present. While there is a prompt template file for feature flags (`prompts/shared/feature_flags.md`), this appears to be used for analyzing other codebases rather than implementing feature flags in this project itself.

The codebase uses environment variables for configuration but these are not implemented as feature flags - they are standard configuration values for things like Temporal settings, API keys, and deployment environment variables.

Therefore, my response is:

```
no feature flag usage detected
```

This codebase could benefit from implementing feature flags for capabilities like:
- Gradually rolling out new analysis capabilities
- A/B testing different prompt strategies
- Kill switches for specific repository analysis features
- Controlling caching behavior

However, these are not currently implemented.

# prompt_security_check

LLM and prompt injection vulnerability assessment

After analyzing the repository structure and files, I can identify clear LLM usage and integrations. Here is my security assessment:

## Part 1: LLM Usage Detection

### 1.1 LLM Infrastructure Identification

Found multiple indicators of LLM integration, primarily using Anthropic's Claude:

1. **Core LLM Component:**
- Location: `src/investigator/core/claude_analyzer.py`
- Type: API-based LLM (Anthropic Claude)
- Purpose: Repository analysis and code understanding

2. **Testing Infrastructure:**
- Multiple test files related to Claude integration:
  - `tests/unit/test_claude_activity_integration.py`
  - `tests/unit/test_claude_activity_models.py`
  - `tests/unit/test_claude_analyzer_prompt_cleaning.py`

3. **Prompt Management System:**
- Extensive prompt infrastructure in `/prompts` directory
- Organized by domain (frontend, backend, shared, etc.)
- Version-aware caching and security checks indicated by test files

### 1.2 Detailed Usage Documentation

#### Usage #1: Claude Repository Analyzer

**Type:** API-based
**Technology:** Anthropic Claude
**Location:**
- Primary: `src/investigator/core/claude_analyzer.py`
- Related: `src/investigator/core/repository_analyzer.py`

## Part 2: Security Vulnerability Assessment

### 2.1 Lethal Trifecta Analysis

| Component | Present | Details |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Private Data Access | YES | Repository code access |
| External Communication | YES | Claude API calls |
| Untrusted Input | YES | Repository content processing |

**Risk Level: CRITICAL** - All three components present

### 2.2 Key Vulnerabilities

1. **Prompt Injection Risks:**
- Location: Prompt handling in `claude_analyzer.py`
- Risk: Repository content could contain malicious prompts

2. **Version Control:**
- Evidence of version control in caching system
- Good practice: Version-aware prompt management

3. **Security Checks:**
- Dedicated security check prompts: `prompts/shared/security_check.md`
- Specific prompt security testing: `test_prompt_security_llm_example.py`

### 2.3 Positive Security Controls

1. Prompt cleaning implementation:
- `test_claude_analyzer_prompt_cleaning.py`
- Indicates sanitization measures

2. Caching with version awareness:
- `test_version_aware_caching.py`
- Reduces attack surface through result caching

3. Security-focused test suite:
- Multiple security-related test files
- Indicates security-conscious development

## Part 3: Recommendations

### 3.1 Critical Fixes

1. **Input Validation:**
- Strengthen repository content validation before prompt construction
- Add additional sanitization layers

2. **Access Control:**
- Implement stricter repository access controls
- Add rate limiting for API calls

3. **Output Validation:**
- Add additional validation for Claude responses
- Implement output sanitization

### 3.2 Architectural Improvements

1. **Prompt Security:**
- Implement allowlist-based prompt template system
- Add prompt injection detection

2. **Monitoring:**
- Add comprehensive logging
- Implement anomaly detection

The repository shows thoughtful LLM integration with some security measures, but the presence of the lethal trifecta requires immediate attention to the recommended security improvements.

# data_layer

Data persistence and access patterns

Based on the repository structure and code files, I'll analyze the actual data layer components present in this backend service.

## Database Architecture

1. **Primary Database: DynamoDB**
- Type: NoSQL
- Purpose: Caching and storing investigation results
- Evidence: `src/utils/dynamodb_client.py` and integration tests in `tests/integration/test_dynamodb_integration.py`

2. **Data Models/Entities:**
Located in `src/models/`:
- `cache.py`: Cache-related models
- `investigation.py`: Investigation data structures
- `workflows.py`: Workflow state models
- `activities.py`: Activity-related data models

## Data Access Layer

1. **DynamoDB Access:**
- Custom client implementation in `src/utils/dynamodb_client.py`
- Repository pattern implementation through:
  - `src/utils/prompt_context_dynamodb.py`
  - `src/utils/prompt_context_base.py` (base abstract class)

2. **Cache Implementation:**
- Caching logic in `src/activities/investigation_cache.py`
- Cache activities in `src/activities/investigation_cache_activities.py`
- Version-aware caching (evidenced by tests in `tests/unit/test_version_aware_caching.py`)

## Data Operations

1. **CRUD Operations:**
- Investigation cache operations:
  - Read/write operations in investigation cache
  - Version-aware data handling (see `test_investigation_cache_version_aware_decisions.py`)

2. **Data Validation:**
- Health check validation (`src/health_check.py`)
- DynamoDB health checks (`src/activities/dynamodb_health_check_activity.py`)

## Data Security

1. **Access Control:**
- Environment-based configuration
- API key authentication (TEMPORAL_API_KEY in Dockerfile)
- GitHub token authentication (GITHUB_TOKEN in Dockerfile)

## Testing Infrastructure

1. **Test Data Management:**
- Mocked DynamoDB testing using moto library (referenced in pyproject.toml dev dependencies)
- Local DynamoDB testing (`tests/unit/test_dynamodb_local.py`)
- Integration tests for DynamoDB (`tests/integration/test_dynamodb_integration.py`)

## Notable Patterns

1. **Repository Pattern:**
- Abstract base class: `prompt_context_base.py`
- Concrete implementations:
  - File-based: `prompt_context_file.py`
  - DynamoDB-based: `prompt_context_dynamodb.py`

2. **Versioning Support:**
- Version-aware caching system
- Prompt version management
- Cache invalidation based on version changes

This analysis is based solely on the actual components present in the codebase, excluding any theoretical or commonly used patterns that aren't implemented here.

# events_and_messaging

Asynchronous communication and event patterns

After analyzing the codebase, here are the asynchronous communication patterns identified:

## Temporal Workflow Patterns
The primary async communication is implemented through Temporal workflows:

1. **Workflow Definitions:**
- `investigate_repos_workflow.py`
- `investigate_single_repo_workflow.py`

2. **Activity Patterns:**
Located in `src/activities/`:
- `investigation_cache_activities.py`
- `investigate_activities.py`
- `dynamodb_health_check_activity.py`

3. **Worker Implementation:**
- `worker.py` - Main Temporal worker 
- `investigate_worker.py` - Investigation-specific worker

## Caching Patterns
Asynchronous caching implemented in:
- `src/models/cache.py`
- `src/activities/investigation_cache.py`
- Using DynamoDB as backend (`src/utils/dynamodb_client.py`)

While there are files discussing events and messaging (`prompts/backend/events_and_messaging.md`, `prompts/shared/events.md`), these appear to be prompt templates rather than actual implementations.

The codebase primarily uses Temporal for workflow orchestration and async task execution, rather than traditional message brokers or event streaming platforms. The async patterns are focused on long-running investigation workflows rather than event-driven architectures.

No traditional message brokers (RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.) or event bus implementations were found in the actual code.
