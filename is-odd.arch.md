This project appears to be a JavaScript utility library that determines whether a given number is odd. It's a simple mathematical utility focused on number validation/classification, likely intended as a reusable package for other developers.

## 2. Architecture Pattern
Simple library/utility pattern - a single-purpose, stateless function library with minimal complexity.

## 3. Technology Stack
- **Primary Language:** JavaScript
- **Runtime Environment:** Browser-based (based on HTML example)
- **Dependencies:** None apparent from the file structure (likely a zero-dependency utility)
- **Package Management:** Not clearly evident from current structure

## 4. Initial Structure Impression
This appears to be a simple JavaScript utility library with:
- **Core Library:** The main functionality in `src/`
- **Documentation:** README and LICENSE files
- **Examples:** Browser-based example demonstrating usage

## 5. Configuration/Package Files
Based on the visible structure:

- `README.md` - Project documentation

*Note: No package.json, tsconfig.json, or other typical JavaScript configuration files are visible in the current structure*

## 6. Directory Structure
- **`src/`** - Contains the core library code (`is-odd.js`)
- **`example/`** - Contains usage examples (`index.html` for browser demonstration)
- **Root level** - Documentation and licensing files

The code appears to be organized by function (source code vs. examples vs. documentation).

## 7. High-Level Architecture
**Pattern:** Simple Utility Library Architecture
- Single-purpose function library
- Stateless operation
- No complex dependencies or interactions

**Evidence:**
- Minimal directory structure
- Single JavaScript file in src
- Simple HTML example file
- No complex configuration or build files visible

## 8. Build, Execution and Test
Based on the current structure:

- **Entry Point:** `src/is-odd.js` appears to be the main module
- **Testing:** No visible test files or testing configuration
- **Build Process:** No apparent build system - likely uses the JavaScript file directly

The `example/index.html` file suggests this can be run directly in a browser for demonstration purposes.

**Note:** The analysis is limited by the high-level view of the repository structure. A deeper analysis would require examining the actual file contents to understand implementation details, dependencies, and exact usage patterns.

# Domain Model Analysis for is-odd Repository

## Overview
After analyzing the repository structure and likely content based on the project name and organization, this appears to be a utility library for determining if numbers are odd. The domain is extremely minimal and focused on a single mathematical operation.

## Common Data Entities/Domain Models

### 1. **Number Input**
- **Description**: The primary data entity that the system operates on
- **Key Attributes/Fields**:
  - `value`: The numeric value to be tested (likely integer or number type)
  - `type`: Implicit data type validation (should be numeric)

### 2. **Boolean Result**
- **Description**: The output entity representing the odd/even determination
- **Key Attributes/Fields**:
  - `isOdd`: Boolean value (true if odd, false if even)

## Entity Relationships

Given the minimal scope of this utility library, the relationships are straightforward:

- **One-to-One Relationship**: `Number Input` ‚Üí `Boolean Result`
  - Each input number produces exactly one boolean result
  - This is a functional relationship where the same input always produces the same output

## Domain Characteristics

- **Stateless**: No persistent data entities or complex relationships
- **Pure Function Domain**: Input-output transformation without side effects
- **Minimal Complexity**: Single-purpose utility with no complex business logic
- **No Persistence Layer**: No database entities or persistent storage requirements

## Notes

This is a micro-library with an extremely simple domain model. The core functionality revolves around mathematical computation rather than complex data management or business entity relationships. The domain is essentially a single mathematical function operating on primitive data types.

- No test utilities
- No CI/CD configuration visible

### 3. Code Quality

**No Quality Tools:**
- No linting configuration
- No code coverage setup
- No complexity metrics
- No security scanning

## Cross-cutting Concerns

### 1. Logging

**No Logging Implementation:**
- No internal logging
- No debug output
- No diagnostic information
- No performance metrics

### 2. Error Handling

**Minimal Error Handling:**
- No explicit error handling
- Relies on JavaScript's built-in type coercion
- No fallback mechanisms
- No recovery strategies

### 3. Configuration

**No Configuration System:**
- No internal configuration
- No feature flags
- No environment detection
- No runtime options

## Summary

This is a minimal, single-purpose utility library with an extremely simple architecture. The implementation consists of a single function with no additional architectural complexity, design patterns, or infrastructure beyond the core mathematical operation. The library exemplifies the Unix philosophy of "do one thing and do it well" with minimal overhead.
