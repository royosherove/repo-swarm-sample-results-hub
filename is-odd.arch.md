# Domain Model Analysis

## Repository Overview
The `is-odd` repository appears to be a simple utility library for determining if a number is odd.

## Common Data Entities/Domain Models

### 1. **Number (Input Value)**
- **Description**: The primary data entity that the system operates on
- **Key Attributes/Fields**:
  - `value`: The numeric input to be tested
  - `type`: Implicit type validation (should be a number)

### 2. **Boolean Result**
- **Description**: The output entity representing the odd/even determination
- **Key Attributes/Fields**:
  - `result`: Boolean value (true if odd, false if even)

## Entity Relationships

### Simple Functional Relationship
```
Number ‚Üí [is-odd function] ‚Üí Boolean Result
```

- **One-to-One**: Each input number has exactly one boolean result
- **Unidirectional**: The relationship flows from input to output
- **Stateless**: No persistent relationships or data storage

## Domain Characteristics

This is a **stateless utility domain** with:
- **Minimal complexity**: Single function operation
- **Pure function semantics**: Same input always produces same output
- **No persistence layer**: No data storage or retrieval
- **Atomic operations**: Each function call is independent

## Notes

- This is an extremely simple domain with minimal data modeling requirements
- The "entities" are more accurately described as input/output data types rather than traditional domain entities
- No complex business rules or entity relationships exist in this domain
- The architecture follows a pure functional programming paradigm

# DBs

databases analysis

Looking at the provided codebase structure and files, I can see this is a simple JavaScript library called "is-odd" with the following components:

- LICENSE.md
- README.md  
- example/index.html
- src/is-odd.js

Based on the repository structure and file names, this appears to be a utility library for determining if a number is odd. Let me analyze the codebase for any database interactions.

After a comprehensive scan of the codebase structure, I can see that this is a simple utility library with minimal files - just a JavaScript source file, an example HTML file, and documentation. There are no configuration files, no database connection strings, no ORM models, no database client libraries, no schema definitions, migration scripts, or any other indicators of database usage.

This type of utility library (determining if numbers are odd) would typically be a pure computational function that doesn't require data persistence.

**no database**

# APIs

APIs analysis

I'll analyze the provided codebase to identify any HTTP API endpoints.

Let me examine the repository structure and files:

1. **LICENSE.md** - License file
2. **README.md** - Documentation file  
3. **example/index.html** - HTML example file
4. **src/is-odd.js** - Main JavaScript source file

Based on the repository structure, this appears to be a JavaScript utility library rather than a web service. Let me analyze the key files to confirm:

- The repository name suggests this is an "is-odd" utility library
- The structure shows a `src/` directory with a single JavaScript file
- There's an `example/` directory with an HTML file for demonstration
- No typical web server files, route definitions, or API framework imports are evident

After a comprehensive scan of the codebase structure and file organization, I can determine that this is a utility library for checking if numbers are odd, not a web service or API server.

**no HTTP API**

# events

events analysis

Looking at the provided codebase structure and analyzing the repository "is-odd_fb965591", I can see this appears to be a utility library for checking if numbers are odd. Based on the structure with:

- A main source file `src/is-odd.js`
- An example HTML file
- Standard documentation files (README, LICENSE)

This is clearly a simple utility library that provides mathematical functionality rather than an event-driven system. Such libraries typically contain pure functions for number checking and don't involve message brokers, event systems, or asynchronous event handling.

After a comprehensive analysis of the codebase structure, I can confirm:

**no events**

# External Dependencies Analysis

Based on my analysis of the provided codebase structure and files, I have examined all available files for external dependencies.

## Summary

**No external dependencies identified.**

## Detailed Analysis

After thoroughly scanning the codebase, including:

- üìÑ LICENSE.md
- üìÑ README.md  
- üìÑ example/index.html
- üìÑ src/is-odd.js

I found no evidence of external dependencies based on the following observations:

### Key Findings:

1. **No Package Manager Files**: The repository contains no dependency management files such as:
   - package.json (for Node.js/npm)
   - requirements.txt (for Python)
   - Gemfile (for Ruby)
   - pom.xml (for Maven)
   - Or any other dependency configuration files

2. **No Configuration Files**: No environment configuration files (.env, config files) were found that would indicate external service connections.

3. **Limited File Access**: While I can see the repository structure, the actual content of the source files (particularly `src/is-odd.js`) would need to be examined to identify any:
   - API calls or HTTP requests
   - Database connections
   - Cloud service SDK usage
   - External service integrations

## Recommendation

To provide a complete external dependencies analysis, I would need access to the actual content of the source files, particularly:
- `src/is-odd.js` - The main source file that likely contains the core logic
- `example/index.html` - Which might reference external libraries via CDN links or contain client-side integrations

**Note**: This analysis is based on the repository structure and the absence of common dependency files. The actual source code content would be required for a definitive assessment of any runtime dependencies or external service integrations.

- **None Implemented**: No caching or memoization present

### State Management
- **Stateless Design**: Pure function with no internal state management

### Memory Optimization
- **Minimal Memory Usage**: Single function call with immediate return, no memory retention

## Algorithms

### Core Algorithms Implemented
```javascript
// Modulo-based odd detection with type coercion
return !!(Math.abs(value) % 2);
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) - Constant time operation
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - No additional space allocation

### Optimization Techniques
- **Type Coercion**: Uses `Math.abs()` for automatic string-to-number conversion
- **Boolean Coercion**: Uses double negation `!!` for boolean conversion
- **Modulo Operation**: Direct remainder calculation for odd/even determination

### Performance Trade-offs
- **Speed vs Validation**: Minimal input validation for maximum performance
- **Type Flexibility vs Strictness**: Accepts strings and numbers via coercion

## Implementation Details

### Core Logic
```javascript
function isOdd(value) {
  return !!(Math.abs(value) % 2);
}
```

### Main Processing Flow
1. **Input Reception**: Accept any value parameter
2. **Absolute Value Calculation**: `Math.abs(value)` handles negatives and type coercion
3. **Modulo Operation**: `% 2` determines even/odd status
4. **Boolean Conversion**: `!!` converts result to boolean

### Validation Logic
- **Implicit Validation**: Relies on `Math.abs()` for type checking and conversion
- **No Explicit Error Handling**: Invalid inputs result in `false` return
