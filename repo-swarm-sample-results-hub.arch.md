High level overview of the codebase

# Project Analysis

## 0. **Repository Name:** 
[[repo-swarm-sample-results-hub]]

## 1. **Project Purpose:**
This appears to be a results aggregation hub for a "repo-swarm" system. Based on the architecture files present (multiple `.arch.md` files for different repositories like `is-even`, `is-odd`, `test-repo-1`, etc.), this project seems to collect and consolidate architectural documentation and analysis results from multiple repositories that have been processed by a repository swarm analysis tool.

## 2. **Architecture Pattern:**
Documentation-centric aggregation pattern - this appears to be a centralized hub that collects and organizes architectural analysis results from distributed repository analysis processes.

## 3. **Technology Stack:**
- **Primary Format**: Markdown documentation
- **Development Environment**: Cursor IDE (evidenced by `.cursor/` configuration)
- **No traditional programming languages** detected - this appears to be a documentation/results repository rather than an executable codebase

## 4. **Initial Structure Impression:**
The application appears to be structured as:
- **Results Hub**: Collection of architectural documentation files (`.arch.md`)
- **IDE Configuration**: Cursor IDE settings and rules
- **Documentation**: README and licensing information

## 5. **Configuration/Package Files:**
- `.cursor/rules/special-tooling.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/ignore-reports-folder-for-queries.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/report-and-query-placement.mdc`
- `.cursor/commands/report.md`
- `LICENSE`
- `README.md`

## 6. **Directory Structure:**
- **Root Level**: Contains individual repository architecture files (`.arch.md` files)
- **`.cursor/`**: IDE-specific configuration directory
  - **`rules/`**: Contains IDE behavior rules for handling reports and queries
  - **`commands/`**: Contains IDE command definitions

## 7. **High-Level Architecture:**
**Centralized Documentation Hub Pattern** - Evidence includes:
- Multiple `.arch.md` files suggesting this is a collection point for architectural analyses
- Cursor IDE rules specifically for handling reports and queries
- Naming convention suggests this aggregates results from multiple source repositories
- No executable code structure, indicating this is a documentation/results repository

## 8. **Build, Execution and Test:**
This appears to be a **documentation repository** rather than an executable project:
- **No build scripts** or package management files detected
- **No main entry points** for execution
- **No test frameworks** identified
- The project likely functions as a **static documentation hub** that is populated by external repo-swarm analysis tools
- Interaction appears to be primarily through the Cursor IDE with custom rules for report generation and querying

The repository serves as a centralized collection point for architectural analysis results rather than a traditional executable software project.
