## 0. **Repository Name:** 
[[repo-swarm-sample-results-hub]]

## 1. **Project Purpose:**
Based on the repository structure, this appears to be a documentation and tooling hub focused on architectural patterns and development workflows. The project seems to solve problems related to:
- Documenting architectural decisions and patterns (evidenced by multiple `.arch.md` files)
- Providing development tooling and automation through Cursor IDE integration
- Managing queries and reports in a structured manner

The primary domain appears to be **software architecture documentation and development tooling**.

## 2. **Architecture Pattern:**
**Documentation-Driven Architecture** with **Tool-Integrated Workflow Management** - The project follows a pattern where architectural decisions are documented as first-class artifacts alongside specialized tooling for managing development workflows.

## 3. **Technology Stack:**
- **Primary Format:** Markdown documentation
- **Development Environment:** Cursor IDE (evidenced by `.cursor/` directory structure)
- **Documentation Framework:** Custom architectural documentation system using `.arch.md` files
- **No traditional programming dependencies identified** - this appears to be primarily a documentation and tooling configuration repository

## 4. **Initial Structure Impression:**
The application appears to be organized into two main high-level parts:
- **Documentation Layer:** Architecture documentation files at the root level
- **Tooling Layer:** Cursor IDE integration and automation tools under `.cursor/`

## 5. **Configuration/Package Files:**
- `LICENSE` - Project licensing
- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` - Cursor IDE rule configurations
- `.cursor/commands/report.md` - Command definitions for tooling

No traditional package management files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.) were found.

## 6. **Directory Structure:**
- **Root Level:** Contains architectural documentation files (`*.arch.md`) and standard project files
- **`.cursor/`** - Cursor IDE integration directory
  - **`rules/`** - Contains rule definitions for development workflows
  - **`commands/`** - Contains command definitions for automation

The code organization follows a **documentation-first approach** with supporting tooling infrastructure.

## 7. **High-Level Architecture:**
**Documentation-Centric Architecture** with the following evidence:
- Multiple `.arch.md` files suggest a structured approach to architectural documentation
- Cursor IDE integration indicates a tool-assisted development workflow
- Rule-based system for managing queries and reports suggests automated workflow management
- Separation of concerns between documentation (root) and tooling (`.cursor/`)

## 8. **Build, Execution and Test:**
- **Build Process:** Appears to be documentation-focused, likely rendered through markdown processors
- **Execution:** Primary interaction seems to be through Cursor IDE commands and rules
- **Main Entry Points:** 
  - Documentation entry points: Various `.arch.md` files (open.arch.md, is-even.arch.md, etc.)
  - Tooling entry points: `.cursor/commands/report.md` for report generation
- **Testing:** No traditional testing framework identified; likely relies on documentation validation and tooling verification

The project appears to be executed primarily through Cursor IDE integration rather than traditional build/run cycles.

# module_deep_dive

Deep dive into modules

I notice that the repository structure you've provided doesn't contain the typical software application components that would have modules like `@src/models/`, `@src/utils/`, or `@src/api/`. Instead, this appears to be a documentation-focused repository with architecture files and Cursor IDE configuration.

Let me analyze the components that are present:

## Detailed Component Breakdown

### 1. Root Architecture Files

#### **Core Responsibility:**
These files appear to define architectural documentation for different utilities or modules, likely following some standardized architecture documentation format.

#### **Key Components:**
- **open.arch.md**: Architecture documentation for an "open" utility/module
- **is-even.arch.md**: Architecture documentation for an "is-even" utility 
- **is.arch.md**: Architecture documentation for a base "is" utility
- **is-odd.arch.md**: Architecture documentation for an "is-odd" utility

#### **Dependencies & Interactions:**
- These appear to be standalone documentation files
- Based on naming, there may be logical relationships (e.g., `is-even` and `is-odd` likely depend on or relate to the base `is` module)
- No apparent external service dependencies from the file structure alone

### 2. `.cursor/rules/` Directory

#### **Core Responsibility:**
Configuration files for Cursor IDE that define development rules and constraints for the project.

#### **Key Components:**
- **special-tooling.mdc**: Likely defines rules for special development tools or workflows
- **ignore-reports-folder-for-queries.mdc**: Configuration to exclude reports folders from IDE queries
- **report-and-query-placement.mdc**: Rules governing where reports and queries should be placed

#### **Dependencies & Interactions:**
- Internal dependencies: These rules likely govern how other components in the project are handled
- External dependencies: Integrates with Cursor IDE functionality
- No apparent API interactions

### 3. `.cursor/commands/` Directory

#### **Core Responsibility:**
Custom commands configuration for Cursor IDE to streamline development workflows.

#### **Key Components:**
- **report.md**: Defines a custom command for generating or handling reports

#### **Dependencies & Interactions:**
- Internal dependencies: Likely interacts with the rules defined in the `rules/` directory
- External dependencies: Integrates with Cursor IDE command system
- May interact with report generation functionality (though the actual implementation isn't visible in this structure)

### 4. Root Documentation Files

#### **Core Responsibility:**
Standard repository documentation and licensing.

#### **Key Components:**
- **README.md**: Project overview and usage instructions
- **LICENSE**: Legal licensing terms for the project

#### **Dependencies & Interactions:**
- These are typically standalone files
- README.md may reference other components in the repository
- No external service dependencies

## Summary
