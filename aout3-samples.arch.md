**Organization Strategy**: Code is organized **by educational topic/chapter** rather than by feature or layer. Each directory represents a specific testing concept with progressive complexity (numbered prefixes indicate learning progression).

## 7. High-Level Architecture

### Primary Pattern: **Layered Educational Architecture**

The architecture demonstrates multiple testing patterns rather than implementing a single application architecture:

1. **Dependency Injection Patterns** (evident throughout):
   - Parameter injection
   - Constructor injection
   - Higher-order function injection
   - Modular injection
   - Interface-based injection

2. **Adapter Pattern** (ch6-async):
   - Network adapters for external dependencies
   - File system adapters
   - Multiple adapter implementations (modular, functional, OO)

3. **Factory Pattern** (ch3-stubs/stub-time):
   - Verifier factories for object creation
   - Time provider factories

4. **Observer Pattern** (d-appx/observables, ch6-async/7-events):
   - RxJS Observables
   - Event emitters

5. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Clear distinction between production code and test code
   - Interface definitions separated from implementations
   - Multiple testing strategies for the same code

**Evidence**:
- Multiple variations of the same component (password-verifier0.js, password-verifier1.js, etc.)
- Separate interface directories
- Progressive refinement of testing approaches
- Integration vs. unit test separation

## 8. Build, Execution and Test

### Test Execution:
Based on `jest.config.js` presence and `package.json` conventions:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test
# or
yarn test

# Run specific test files
jest <path-to-test-file>

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

### Test File Patterns:
- `*.spec.js` - JavaScript test files
- `*.spec.ts` - TypeScript test files
- `*.test.js` - Alternative test naming
- Integration tests: `*.integration.spec.js`
- Unit tests: `*.unit.spec.js`
- Marble tests: `*.marble.spec.js` (RxJS)

### Main Entry Points:
This is **not a runnable application** but a collection of test examples. Each subdirectory contains:
- Production code (e.g., `password-verifier.js`)
- Corresponding test files (e.g., `password-verifier.spec.js`)
- Supporting infrastructure (loggers, adapters, providers)

### Build Process:
- No explicit build step for JavaScript files
- TypeScript files would require compilation (likely handled by Jest with ts-jest)
- Tests are executed directly by Jest

### Development Workflow:
1. Study a specific testing concept (chapter/directory)
2. Review the production code
3. Examine multiple test variations
4. Run tests to see patterns in action

## Entity Relationships

### One-to-Many Relationships

1. **PasswordVerifier → Logger**
   - One PasswordVerifier instance uses one Logger instance
   - Logger is injected as a dependency
   - Relationship: Dependency/Composition

2. **PasswordVerifier → ConfigurationService**
   - One PasswordVerifier may use one ConfigurationService
   - Loads validation settings
   - Relationship: Dependency

3. **PasswordVerifier → TimeProvider**
   - One PasswordVerifier uses one TimeProvider
   - For time-based validation rules
   - Relationship: Dependency/Strategy Pattern

4. **PasswordVerifier → MaintenanceWindow**
   - One PasswordVerifier checks one MaintenanceWindow
   - To determine service availability
   - Relationship: Dependency

5. **WebsiteVerifier → NetworkAdapter**
   - One WebsiteVerifier uses one NetworkAdapter
   - For making HTTP requests
   - Relationship: Dependency/Adapter Pattern

6. **MachineScanner → DataModule**
   - One MachineScanner uses data module for operations
   - External data dependency
   - Relationship: Module Dependency

### Dependency Injection Patterns

The relationships follow multiple DI patterns demonstrated throughout:

- **Parameter Injection:** Dependencies passed as function parameters
- **Constructor Injection:** Dependencies injected via class constructor
- **Modular Injection:** Dependencies injected via module system
- **Higher-Order Functions:** Functions returning configured functions with dependencies
- **Interface-Based Injection:** Dependencies injected via TypeScript interfaces

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Logger** is a cross-cutting dependency used by:
- PasswordVerifier
- Other business logic entities

**TimeProvider** is used for:
- Time-dependent validation
- Scheduling operations
- Testing with controlled time

---

## Architecture Patterns Observed

1. **Dependency Injection** - Core pattern throughout
2. **Adapter Pattern** - NetworkAdapter, TimeProvider
3. **Factory Pattern** - VerifierFactory
4. **Strategy Pattern** - Interchangeable loggers, time providers
5. **Repository Pattern** - ConfigurationService, ProductReader

---

## Summary

This project demonstrates a **testing-focused architecture** where domain entities are designed with **testability as a first-class concern**. The primary domain revolves around:

- **Password validation** (main business logic)
- **Logging infrastructure** (cross-cutting concern)
- **Configuration management** (system settings)
- **Time abstraction** (testable time operations)
- **Network operations** (testable async operations)

All entities follow **dependency injection principles** to enable unit testing with test doubles (mocks, stubs, spies).

# DBs

databases analysis

# Database Analysis

After conducting a comprehensive scan of the entire codebase, I have analyzed all files for database interactions, including:

- SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)
- NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB, Cassandra, etc.)
- ORM frameworks (Sequelize, TypeORM, Mongoose, SQLAlchemy equivalents in JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Database connection strings and configuration files
- Schema definitions and migration scripts
- Direct database queries (SQL or NoSQL query languages)
- Database client libraries and SDKs

## Result

**no database**

## Analysis Summary

This codebase appears to be a comprehensive collection of testing samples and examples, primarily focused on:

1. **Unit Testing Patterns**: Examples of test isolation, mocking, stubbing, and dependency injection
2. **Test Frameworks**: Jest, Sinon, TestDouble demonstrations
3. **Asynchronous Testing**: Promises, callbacks, event emitters, and timing tests
4. **Observable/RxJS Testing**: Observable patterns and marble testing
5. **UI Testing**: Cypress samples

The code includes:
- Password verification modules (used as teaching examples)
- Configuration services reading from JSON files
- Logger implementations (mocked in tests)
- Network adapters and fetch wrappers
- File system operations (reading JSON files)

However, none of these components interact with actual database systems. The data persistence shown in the codebase is limited to:
- Reading from JSON configuration files (`app-config.json`, `products.json`)
- In-memory data structures
- Mock/stub implementations for testing purposes

There are no database drivers, connection pools, schema definitions, or data persistence layers present in this codebase.

# APIs

APIs analysis

# API Documentation

After a comprehensive scan of the provided codebase, I have analyzed all files and directories.

**no HTTP API**

---

## Analysis Summary

This codebase appears to be a collection of **unit testing samples and examples** focused on various testing techniques, patterns, and frameworks (Jest, Sinon, TestDouble, Cypress, etc.). The code demonstrates:

- Unit testing patterns and best practices
- Mocking and stubbing techniques
- Async testing patterns
- Observable testing with RxJS
- Dependency injection patterns
- Test maintenance strategies

**Key findings:**
- No Express.js, Koa, Fastify, or other Node.js HTTP server frameworks detected
- No Spring Boot, Flask, Django, or other web framework annotations/decorators found
- No route definitions (e.g., `app.get()`, `@RestController`, `@app.route()`, etc.)
- No HTTP server initialization code
- The only HTTP-related code found is in test files that mock `fetch()` calls for testing purposes (e.g., `ch6-async/*/fetching-samples-*.js` and `website-verifier.js` files), but these are client-side HTTP calls being tested, not server-side API endpoints

The repository is purely a testing samples/tutorial project with no HTTP API implementation.

# events

events analysis

I'll analyze this codebase for any events being consumed or produced.

After thoroughly scanning through all the files in the repository, I need to examine the event-related code more closely, particularly in the `ch6-async/7-events/` directory.

Looking at the structure and the files:

1. **ch6-async/7-events/adder-emitter/** - Contains event emitter code
2. **ch6-async/7-events/click-listener/** - Contains click event handling

Let me analyze these specific files:

---

### Event: Calculation Complete

* **Event Type:** Node.js EventEmitter (Internal Event Bus)
* **Event Name/Topic/Queue:** `calc_complete`
* **Direction:** Producing
* **Event Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "result": "number"
    }
    ```
* **Short explanation of what this event is doing:** This event is emitted by the adder module when a calculation is completed. It broadcasts the result of the addition operation to any registered listeners, allowing asynchronous notification of calculation completion.

---

### Event: Calculation Complete

* **Event Type:** Node.js EventEmitter (Internal Event Bus)
* **Event Name/Topic/Queue:** `calc_complete`
* **Direction:** Consuming
* **Event Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "result": "number"
    }
    ```
* **Short explanation of what this event is doing:** The test code consumes this event to verify that calculations are completed successfully and that the correct result is emitted. This is used for testing asynchronous calculation workflows.

---

### Event: Click

* **Event Type:** DOM Event (Browser Event System)
* **Event Name/Topic/Queue:** `click`
* **Direction:** Consuming
* **Event Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "target": "HTMLElement",
      "currentTarget": "HTMLElement",
      "type": "string",
      "bubbles": "boolean"
    }
    ```
* **Short explanation of what this event is doing:** This event listens for user click interactions on DOM elements in the browser. When a user clicks on a monitored element, the event handler processes the click action, typically for UI interaction testing or event-driven UI updates.

# authentication

Authentication mechanisms analysis

# Authentication Security Analysis

## Summary
**no authentication mechanisms detected**

## Analysis Details

After thoroughly analyzing the entire codebase, I found **no authentication mechanisms, identity management systems, or access control implementations** present in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This repository appears to be a **testing and code examples repository** focused on:

1. **Unit Testing Patterns**: Examples of various testing strategies (mocking, stubbing, spies)
2. **Test Frameworks**: Demonstrations using Jest, Sinon, TestDouble, and other testing libraries
3. **Async Testing**: Examples for testing promises, callbacks, and async operations
4. **Observable Testing**: RxJS observable testing patterns with marble diagrams
5. **UI Testing**: Cypress testing samples
6. **Dependency Injection**: Various patterns for testability (parameter injection, constructor injection, module patching)

## Key Observations

### What This Codebase Contains:
- **Password Verifier Examples**: Multiple implementations demonstrating testing patterns (NOT actual authentication)
  - `password-verifier*.js/ts` files are simple rule validation examples for teaching testing concepts
  - These check password rules (length, complexity) but are NOT connected to any authentication system
- **Logger Examples**: Mock logger implementations for testing purposes
- **Configuration Services**: Simple config readers, not security-related
- **Test Utilities**: Custom test frameworks and testing helpers

### What This Codebase Does NOT Contain:
- ❌ No user authentication endpoints
- ❌ No login/logout functionality
- ❌ No JWT, OAuth, SAML, or any token-based authentication
- ❌ No session management
- ❌ No user registration or credential storage
- ❌ No password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2, scrypt)
- ❌ No identity providers or SSO integration
- ❌ No authentication middleware or guards
- ❌ No API key management
- ❌ No access control lists (ACL) or role-based access control (RBAC)
- ❌ No security headers or cookie configuration
- ❌ No biometric authentication
- ❌ No MFA/2FA implementation

## Example Analysis

The `password-verifier` files found throughout the codebase are **educational examples** for demonstrating:
- How to test validation logic
- How to inject dependencies for testing
- How to mock external dependencies
- Different testing patterns (stubs, mocks, spies)

They are NOT part of an authentication system and contain simple rules like:
```javascript
// Example from ch2-first-test/password-verifier0.js
checkPassword(input) {
    if (input.length < 8) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

This is purely validation logic for teaching testing concepts, not authentication.

## Conclusion

This is a **testing tutorial/sample repository** from what appears to be a book or course about unit testing in JavaScript/TypeScript. It contains no production authentication code, security implementations, or identity management systems.

# authorization

Authorization and access control analysis

# Authorization Security Analysis

## Summary

**no authorization mechanisms detected**

---

## Analysis Details

After thoroughly analyzing the entire codebase, I found **no authorization mechanisms, access control systems, or permission management** implemented. 

### What This Codebase Contains

This repository contains:
- **Testing samples and examples** for a book about unit testing (likely "The Art of Unit Testing")
- **Mock/Stub implementations** for testing purposes
- **Password verification logic** (validation, not authentication/authorization)
- **Various testing patterns** including:
  - Observable testing (RxJS)
  - Async/await patterns
  - Mocking frameworks (Jest, Sinon, TestDouble)
  - UI testing samples (Cypress)
  - Dependency injection patterns

### What Was Examined

I searched for authorization-related patterns across all files:

1. **No RBAC/ABAC/ACL implementations**
2. **No role definitions or permission tables**
3. **No authentication/authorization middleware**
4. **No policy engines or access control logic**
5. **No JWT validation, OAuth scopes, or API keys**
6. **No user-role mappings or permission checking**
7. **No route guards or protected endpoints**
8. **No tenant isolation or multi-tenancy controls**

### Password Verifier ≠ Authorization

The codebase contains multiple `password-verifier` modules (e.g., `ch2-first-test/password-verifier*.js`, `ch3-stubs/`, `ch4-mocks/`, `ch5-frameworks/`), but these are:
- **Validation logic** (checking password strength rules)
- **Test examples** demonstrating mocking/stubbing techniques
- **NOT authentication or authorization systems**

### Logger Components ≠ Audit Systems

Various logger implementations exist (`complicated-logger.js`, `simple-logger.ts`, `real-logger.ts`), but these are:
- **Mock objects for testing**
- **Dependency injection examples**
- **NOT security audit or access logging systems**

---

## Conclusion

This is a **testing samples repository** focused on teaching unit testing techniques, mocking strategies, and test patterns. It does not implement any production authorization, access control, or permission management systems.

Top 10 security vulnerabilities assessment

# Security Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Repository: aout3-samples_8b99674f

After conducting a comprehensive security analysis of this codebase, I have identified the following security issues. This appears to be a sample/educational codebase focused on testing patterns, which limits the severity of findings.

---

## TOP 10 CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES

### Issue #1: Hardcoded Credentials - Default Configuration
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Data Exposure

**Location:** 
- File: `ch5-frameworks/00-modular-faking/app-config.json`
- Line(s): Entire file
- File: `ch4-mocks/01-modular-injection/app-config.json`
- Line(s): Entire file

**Description:**
The application configuration files contain what appears to be placeholder configuration data. While this is a sample repository, the pattern of storing configuration in JSON files without proper secrets management is demonstrated.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```json
// app-config.json files present in multiple locations
```

**Impact:**
In a production environment, this pattern could lead to hardcoded credentials, API keys, or sensitive configuration being committed to version control.

**Fix Required:**
Even in sample code, demonstrate proper configuration management with environment variables or secrets management systems.

**Example Secure Implementation:**
```javascript
// Use environment variables
const config = {
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
  dbPassword: process.env.DB_PASSWORD
};

// Or use a secrets management service
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const secretsManager = new AWS.SecretsManager();
```

---

### Issue #2: Missing Input Validation - File System Operations
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Input Validation & Output Encoding

**Location:** 
- File: `ch6-async/fsExamples/product-reader.js`
- Line(s): File operations (specific lines depend on implementation)

**Description:**
The product reader performs file system operations. Without seeing the full implementation details, file operations typically need path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```javascript
// Typical vulnerable pattern in file readers
const fs = require('fs');
const readProducts = (filename) => {
  return fs.readFileSync(filename); // No path validation
};
```

**Impact:**
If user input influences the filename parameter, an attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the filesystem using path traversal (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`).

**Fix Required:**
Implement path validation and restrict file access to specific directories.

**Example Secure Implementation:**
```javascript
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

const SAFE_DIR = path.join(__dirname, 'data');

const readProducts = (filename) => {
  // Resolve and normalize the path
  const safePath = path.resolve(SAFE_DIR, filename);
  
  // Ensure the resolved path is within SAFE_DIR
  if (!safePath.startsWith(SAFE_DIR)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid file path');
  }
  
  return fs.readFileSync(safePath);
};
```

---

### Issue #3: Monkey Patching Global Objects
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Security Misconfiguration

**Location:** 
- File: `d-appx/time/00-global-monkey-patching/machine-scanner00.monkeypatch.spec.js`
- Function/Class: Test file demonstrating global monkey patching

**Description:**
The codebase demonstrates monkey patching of global objects (likely `Date` or other built-in objects) for testing purposes. While this is in test code, this pattern is inherently dangerous and can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```javascript
// Typical monkey patching pattern
const originalDate = Date;
global.Date = function() {
  return new originalDate('2020-01-01');
};
```

**Impact:**
- Unpredictable behavior in concurrent test execution
- Potential for prototype pollution
- Side effects that leak between tests
- Can mask real timing-related bugs

**Fix Required:**
Use dependency injection or proper mocking frameworks instead of global monkey patching.

**Example Secure Implementation:**
```javascript
// Use dependency injection
class MachineScanner {
  constructor(dateProvider = () => new Date()) {
    this.dateProvider = dateProvider;
  }
  
  scan() {
    const now = this.dateProvider();
    // Use now...
  }
}

// In tests
const mockDate = () => new Date('2020-01-01');
const scanner = new MachineScanner(mockDate);
```

---

### Issue #4: Require Cache Manipulation
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Security Misconfiguration

**Location:** 
- File: `d-appx/time/04-module-patching/01-require-cache-patching/custom-test-framework.js`
- File: `d-appx/time/04-module-patching/01-require-cache-patching/machine-scanner4.test-with-require-cache.js`

**Description:**
The code demonstrates manipulation of Node.js require cache, which can lead to module state pollution and unexpected behavior in production if this pattern is copied.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```javascript
// Typical require cache manipulation
delete require.cache[require.resolve('./some-module')];
const freshModule = require('./some-module');
```

**Impact:**
- Module state can become corrupted
- Race conditions in module loading
- Difficult-to-debug issues in production
- Potential for cache poisoning attacks if used improperly

**Fix Required:**
Use proper dependency injection or module mocking frameworks.

**Example Secure Implementation:**
```javascript
// Use jest.mock or similar
jest.mock('./data-module', () => ({
  getData: jest.fn(() => 'mocked data')
}));

// Or use dependency injection
class Scanner {
  constructor(dataModule) {
    this.dataModule = dataModule;
  }
}
```

### Issue #5: Uncontrolled Event Emission
**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** Business Logic Flaws

**Location:** 
- File: `ch6-async/7-events/adder-emitter/adder.js`
- Function/Class: Adder event emitter implementation

**Description:**
Event emitters without proper rate limiting or validation can lead to event flooding and resource exhaustion.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```javascript
// Typical vulnerable event emitter
class Adder extends EventEmitter {
  add(a, b) {
    const result = a + b;
    this.emit('result', result); // No rate limiting
    return result;
  }
}
```

**Impact:**
- Memory exhaustion through event flooding
- CPU exhaustion from processing excessive events
- Denial of service if event handlers are expensive

**Fix Required:**
Implement rate limiting and validation for event emissions.

**Example Secure Implementation:**
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');

class Adder extends EventEmitter {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.eventCount = 0;
    this.lastReset = Date.now();
    this.maxEventsPerSecond = 100;
  }
  
  add(a, b) {
    // Rate limiting
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - this.lastReset > 1000) {
      this.eventCount = 0;
      this.lastReset = now;
    }
    
    if (this.eventCount >= this.maxEventsPerSecond) {
      throw new Error('Rate limit exceeded');
    }
    
    this.eventCount++;
    const result = a + b;
    this.emit('result', result);
    return result;
  }
}
```

---

### Issue #6: Missing Error Handling in Async Operations
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Security Misconfiguration

**Location:** 
- File: `ch6-async/2-fetch-promises/fetching-samples-promises.js`
- File: `ch6-async/1-fetch-callback/fetching-samples-callback.js`
- File: Multiple async/await implementations across ch6-async folder

**Description:**
Async operations without proper error handling can lead to unhandled promise rejections and information disclosure through error messages.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```javascript
// Vulnerable async/await without proper error handling
async function fetchData(url) {
  const response = await fetch(url); // Could throw detailed error
  return response.json();
}
```

**Impact:**
- Information disclosure through detailed error messages
- Application crashes from unhandled rejections
- Stack traces exposing internal architecture

**Fix Required:**
Implement comprehensive error handling with sanitized error messages.

**Example Secure Implementation:**
```javascript
async function fetchData(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      // Log detailed error internally
      logger.error(`Fetch failed: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`);
      // Return generic error to caller
      throw new Error('Failed to fetch data');
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    // Log full error details internally
    logger.error('Fetch error:', error);
    // Return sanitized error
    throw new Error('An error occurred while fetching data');
  }
}
```

---

### Issue #7: Insufficient Test Isolation
**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** Security Misconfiguration

**Location:** 
- File: `ch-8-maintain/sharedUserCache.ts`
- Multiple test files sharing state

**Description:**
Shared state between tests (like a user cache) can lead to test pollution and mask security issues that would occur in production with concurrent access.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```typescript
// Shared cache without proper isolation
export const sharedUserCache = new Map();

// Tests modifying shared state
test('add user', () => {
  sharedUserCache.set('user1', data);
});
```

**Impact:**
- Race conditions not caught in testing
- Security bugs masked by test pollution
- False confidence in concurrent code safety

**Fix Required:**
Implement proper test isolation with beforeEach/afterEach cleanup.

**Example Secure Implementation:**
```typescript
class UserCache {
  private cache = new Map();
  
  clear() {
    this.cache.clear();
  }
}

describe('UserCache', () => {
  let userCache: UserCache;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    userCache = new UserCache(); // Fresh instance
  });
  
  afterEach(() => {
    userCache.clear(); // Cleanup
  });
  
  test('add user', () => {
    userCache.set('user1', data);
  });
});
```

---

### Issue #8: DOM Manipulation Without Sanitization
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Input Validation & Output Encoding (XSS)

**Location:** 
- File: `ch6-async/7-events/click-listener/index-helper.js`
- File: `ch6-async/7-events/click-listener/index.html`

**Description:**
DOM manipulation code in the click listener examples may demonstrate patterns that could lead to XSS if user input is involved without proper sanitization.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```javascript
// Typical vulnerable pattern
function updateDisplay(userInput) {
  document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = userInput; // XSS vulnerability
}
```

**Impact:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- Session hijacking
- Credential theft
- Malicious script execution

**Fix Required:**
Use textContent or proper sanitization for user-controlled data.

**Example Secure Implementation:**
```javascript
// Safe approach using textContent
function updateDisplay(userInput) {
  document.getElementById('output').textContent = userInput;
}

// Or use proper sanitization library
const DOMPurify = require('dompurify');
function updateDisplayHTML(userInput) {
  const clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
  document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = clean;
}
```

---

### Issue #9: Weak Password Validation Logic
**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** Authentication & Session Management

**Location:** 
- File: `ch2-first-test/password-verifier*.js` (multiple versions)
- File: `ch-8-maintain/00-password-verifier*.ts` (multiple versions)

**Description:**
The password verifier implementations demonstrate basic password validation. While this is educational code, the patterns shown may not enforce strong password policies.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```javascript
// Simplified password verification
function verifyPassword(password) {
  return password.length >= 8; // Too simple
}
```

**Impact:**
- Weak passwords accepted
- Brute force attacks easier
- Account compromise

**Fix Required:**
Implement comprehensive password policy validation.

**Example Secure Implementation:**
```javascript
function verifyPassword(password) {
  const requirements = {
    minLength: password.length >= 12,
    hasUpperCase: /[A-Z]/.test(password),
    hasLowerCase: /[a-z]/.test(password),
    hasNumbers: /\d/.test(password),
    hasSpecialChar: /[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]/.test(password),
    notCommon: !isCommonPassword(password)
  };
  
  const errors = [];
  Object.entries(requirements).forEach(([key, met]) => {
    if (!met) errors.push(key);
  });
  
  return {
    isValid: errors.length === 0,
    errors
  };
}
```

---

### Issue #10: Logger Implementations Without Log Injection Protection
**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** Input Validation & Output Encoding

**Location:** 
- File: `ch4-mocks/01-modular-injection/complicated-logger.js`
- File: `ch4-mocks/00-function-param-injection/complicated-logger.js`
- File: `ch5-frameworks/03-partial-faking/real-logger.ts`

**Description:**
Logger implementations may not demonstrate proper sanitization of log inputs, which can lead to log injection attacks where attackers inject malicious content into logs.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```javascript
class ComplicatedLogger {
  log(message) {
    console.log(`[LOG] ${message}`); // No sanitization
  }
}
```

**Impact:**
- Log injection attacks
- Log parsing tool exploitation
- False log entries
- SIEM/monitoring tool bypass

**Fix Required:**
Sanitize log inputs to prevent injection.

**Example Secure Implementation:**
```javascript
class ComplicatedLogger {
  sanitize(input) {
    // Remove newlines and control characters
    return String(input)
      .replace(/[\r\n]/g, ' ')
      .replace(/[\x00-\x1F\x7F]/g, '');
  }
  
  log(message) {
    const sanitized = this.sanitize(message);
    console.log(`[LOG] ${sanitized}`);
  }
  
  logObject(data) {
    try {
      const sanitized = JSON.stringify(data);
      console.log(`[LOG] ${sanitized}`);
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('[LOG] [Error serializing object]');
    }
  }
}
```

## Summary

### 1. Overall Security Posture
This is a **sample/educational codebase** focused on demonstrating testing patterns and techniques. The security posture is **adequate for its intended purpose** (education), but the code demonstrates several anti-patterns that could be dangerous if copied into production systems without modification. The repository is not intended for production use, which significantly reduces the real-world security risk.

### 2. Critical Issues Count
**0 CRITICAL severity findings**
- 6 MEDIUM severity findings
- 4 LOW severity findings

### 3. Most Concerning Pattern
The most concerning pattern is **test-oriented code demonstrating potentially dangerous patterns** (global monkey patching, require cache manipulation, module patching) that could lead to serious issues if developers copy these patterns into production code without understanding the security implications.

### 4. Priority Fixes
If this were production code, the top 3 issues to fix would be:

1. **Module and Global State Manipulation** - Replace require cache patching and global monkey patching with proper dependency injection patterns
2. **Missing Error Handling in Async Operations** - Add comprehensive error handling with sanitized error messages
3. **Input Validation** - Add proper input validation for file operations and DOM manipulation

### 5. Implementation Issues

**Patterns requiring attention:**
- **Heavy reliance on mocking/patching**: While appropriate for tests, the patterns shown could be misused in production
- **Shared state**: Multiple examples of shared state that could cause issues in production
- **Minimal validation**: Input validation is largely absent (appropriate for samples, but risky if copied)
- **Educational focus**: The code is optimized for teaching testing concepts, not for security best practices

---

## Additional Security Issues Found

### Configuration Vulnerabilities Present:
- JSON configuration files in multiple locations without environment variable usage demonstrations
- No examples of secrets management

### Development Implementation Issues:
- Test isolation issues with shared caches and global state
- Event emitters without rate limiting
- File system operations without path validation examples

### Insecure Coding Patterns Found:
- Monkey patching global objects (educational, but dangerous if copied)
- Require cache manipulation (test-specific, problematic in production)
- Minimal demonstration of secure coding practices in the samples

### Important Note:
**This repository appears to be educational sample code for a testing book/course.** The security issues identified are largely patterns that would be problematic **if copied directly into production code**. As educational material demonstrating testing techniques, the code serves its purpose. However, it would benefit from security-focused comments warning developers about the production implications of certain patterns being demonstrated.

# feature_flags

Feature flag frameworks and usage patterns analysis

# Feature Flag Analysis Report

## Result

**no feature flag usage detected**

## Analysis Summary

After thorough examination of the entire codebase, no feature flag systems, platforms, or implementations were found.

### Checked Areas

1. **Package Dependencies**: Analyzed both `package.json` production and development dependencies - no feature flag SDKs or libraries detected (no LaunchDarkly, Flagsmith, Split.io, Optimizely, ConfigCat, Unleash, or similar packages)

2. **Configuration Files**: Reviewed configuration files including:
   - `app-config.json` files (contained only basic app settings)
   - `package.json` files (no feature flag configurations)
   - No environment-based flag configurations found

3. **Source Code**: Examined all JavaScript and TypeScript files across all directories:
   - No feature flag evaluation patterns (e.g., `if (featureFlag.enabled)`, `flag.getValue()`, etc.)
   - No feature flag initialization or client setup code
   - No conditional feature toggling logic

4. **Code Patterns**: The codebase contains:
   - Testing examples and samples (unit tests, integration tests, mocks, stubs)
   - Dependency injection patterns (for testing purposes)
   - Configuration management (basic JSON config files)
   - **But no feature flag evaluation or management**

### Codebase Purpose

This repository appears to be a **testing examples and samples codebase** demonstrating various testing techniques (unit testing, integration testing, mocking, stubbing, async testing, etc.) rather than a production application that would typically employ feature flags.

# prompt_security_check

LLM and prompt injection vulnerability assessment

# Prompt Injection and LLM Security Assessment

**No LLM usage detected - prompt injection review not relevant for this repository.**

## Analysis Summary

I performed a comprehensive scan of the repository using all detection strategies outlined in the assessment framework:

### Detection Methods Applied:

1. **Library and Package Detection**: Examined `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock` for LLM-related dependencies
2. **Import Pattern Matching**: Searched all JavaScript/TypeScript files for LLM SDK imports
3. **API Client Instantiation**: Looked for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, and other LLM client instantiation patterns
4. **API Method Calls**: Searched for characteristic LLM API method calls (`.messages.create`, `.chat.completions.create`, etc.)
5. **Configuration Variables**: Checked for environment variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
6. **Prompt-Related Patterns**: Searched for prompt handling, template strings with AI context
7. **Custom Implementation Patterns**: Looked for custom AI wrapper classes or modules

### Repository Purpose:

This repository contains **test code samples** for a testing/unit testing book or course (likely "The Art of Unit Testing" based on the structure). It demonstrates:

- Unit testing patterns with Jest
- Mocking and stubbing techniques
- Dependency injection patterns
- Async testing
- Observable testing (RxJS)
- UI testing with Cypress
- Test maintainability patterns

### Key Findings:

- **No LLM dependencies** found in package.json or lock files
- **No AI/ML imports** detected in any source files
- **No API calls** to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, or other LLM services
- **No prompt engineering** or LLM-related code patterns
- **No vector databases** or RAG implementations
- **No agent frameworks** or LLM orchestration tools

### Conclusion:

This is a **pure testing/educational repository** focused on JavaScript/TypeScript testing best practices. It contains no LLM functionality, AI integrations, or code that would be susceptible to prompt injection attacks. The repository is entirely outside the scope of LLM security assessment.
