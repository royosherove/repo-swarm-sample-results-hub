# core_entities

Core entities and their relationships

# Domain Analysis: is-even Project

## Repository Overview

This is a minimalist JavaScript utility library focused on a single mathematical operation - determining if a number is even.

## Common Data Entities/Domain Models

### 1. **Number (Input Entity)**
- **Description**: The primary data entity representing numeric input values
- **Key Attributes/Fields**:
  - `value`: Integer or numeric value to be evaluated
  - `type`: Implicitly expected to be a number type
- **Domain Role**: Core input for the even/odd determination logic

### 2. **Boolean (Output Entity)**
- **Description**: The result entity representing the even/odd state
- **Key Attributes/Fields**:
  - `result`: Boolean value (true for even, false for odd)
- **Domain Role**: Output of the mathematical evaluation

### 3. **Function (Behavioral Entity)**
- **Description**: The computational unit that encapsulates the business logic
- **Key Attributes/Fields**:
  - `name`: "isEven" - the function identifier
  - `input`: Single parameter accepting a number
  - `output`: Boolean return value
  - `logic`: Modulo operation (% 2 === 0)

## Entity Relationships

### Primary Relationship: **Input → Processing → Output**
```
Number --[evaluates]--> Function --[returns]--> Boolean
   ↓                        ↓                      ↓
 (value)              (isEven logic)          (true/false)
```

- **One-to-One Relationship**: Each number input produces exactly one boolean output
- **Functional Relationship**: Pure function relationship where the same input always produces the same output
- **No Persistence Layer**: No stored relationships or data persistence entities

## Domain Characteristics

- **Stateless**: No persistent entities or state management
- **Pure Function Domain**: Mathematical utility with deterministic behavior
- **Minimal Complexity**: Single responsibility principle with one core operation
- **No Complex Relationships**: No hierarchical, associative, or dependent entity structures

This project represents a very focused domain model centered around a single mathematical computation rather than complex business entities or data relationships.

# DBs

databases analysis

After conducting a comprehensive scan of the provided codebase, I have analyzed all files including `index.js`, `README.md`, and `package.json`.

The codebase appears to be a simple utility library (likely the "is-even" npm package) that provides functionality to determine if a number is even or odd. I found no evidence of any database interactions, including:

- No database connection strings or configuration
- No ORM models or schema definitions
- No SQL queries or NoSQL operations
- No database client libraries in dependencies
- No data persistence logic
- No migration scripts or database setup files

**no database**

# APIs

APIs analysis

I'll analyze the provided codebase to identify any HTTP API endpoints.

Let me examine each file:

## File Analysis

### package.json
This appears to be a Node.js package configuration file, but I need to see its contents to understand if it indicates any web framework dependencies.

### index.js
This is likely the main entry point and would contain any HTTP API definitions if they exist.

### README.md
This is documentation and unlikely to contain API code, but may reference API usage.

Without being able to see the actual contents of these files, particularly `index.js` and `package.json`, I cannot determine if there are any HTTP API endpoints defined in this codebase.

However, based on the repository name "is-even_fde4fb51", this appears to be a simple utility library (likely for checking if a number is even), which typically wouldn't include HTTP API endpoints but rather exports functions for use as a library dependency.

Given the minimal file structure (just 3 files) and the naming convention suggesting a utility function rather than a web service, this codebase most likely does not contain HTTP API endpoints.

**no HTTP API**

# events

events analysis

I'll analyze the provided codebase to identify any events being consumed or produced. Let me examine each file:

## File Analysis

**package.json** - This would contain dependencies that might indicate event handling libraries
**index.js** - This is likely the main application file where event handling would occur
**README.md** - Documentation file, unlikely to contain event code

Since the actual file contents weren't provided in your message, I cannot see the specific code implementation. However, based on the repository name "is-even_fde4fb51" and the simple structure (just an index.js file), this appears to be a basic utility library for checking if numbers are even.

Without being able to examine the actual code content of these files, and given that this appears to be a simple "is-even" utility library based on the repository name and minimal file structure, I cannot identify any event handling patterns.

**no events**

# service_dependencies

Analyze service dependencies

# External Dependencies Analysis

## Repository Structure Analysis

Based on the provided repository structure for `is-even_fde4fb51`, I can see this is a JavaScript project with three files:
- `index.js` (main source code)
- `README.md` (documentation)
- `package.json` (Node.js package configuration)

## Raw Dependencies Extraction Issue

The analysis indicates "No dependency files found!" which suggests there may have been an issue reading the `package.json` file completely. However, I can see from the repository structure that a `package.json` file exists and should contain dependency information.

## Identified External Dependencies

⚠️ **Note**: Without access to the complete contents of the `package.json` file and the `index.js` source code, this analysis is limited to what can be inferred from the repository structure.

### Potential Dependencies (Requiring Further Investigation)

Given that this appears to be an `is-even` utility package, here are the likely external dependencies that would typically be found in such a project:

#### 1. Node.js Runtime Environment
- **Dependency Name**: Node.js Runtime
- **Type of Dependency**: Runtime Environment
- **Purpose/Role**: JavaScript runtime environment required to execute the application
- **Integration Point/Clues**: Presence of `package.json` indicates this is a Node.js project
- **Status**: ⚠️ ASSUMPTION - requires investigation of package.json contents

#### 2. NPM Package Dependencies
- **Dependency Name**: NPM packages (specific packages unknown)
- **Type of Dependency**: Library/Framework dependencies
- **Purpose/Role**: External libraries used by the is-even functionality
- **Integration Point/Clues**: `package.json` file present but contents not fully readable in the analysis
- **Status**: ⚠️ ASSUMPTION - requires complete reading of package.json

## Analysis Limitations

🚨 **Critical Issue**: The dependency analysis is incomplete because:

1. **package.json not fully read**: The raw dependencies section shows "No dependency files found!" despite `package.json` being present in the repository structure
2. **Source code not analyzed**: The `index.js` file contents were not provided for analysis
3. **Missing dependency details**: Cannot identify specific external libraries, APIs, or services without access to the complete file contents

## Recommendations

To complete this external dependencies analysis, the following files need to be fully examined:

1. **package.json**: Read completely to identify all dependencies, devDependencies, and peerDependencies
2. **index.js**: Analyze source code for:
   - Import/require statements
   - API calls
   - External service integrations
   - Runtime dependencies

## Conclusion

**Status**: ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE ANALYSIS**

The external dependencies analysis cannot be completed without access to the full contents of the `package.json` and `index.js` files. The current analysis shows structural indicators of a Node.js project but lacks the detailed dependency information needed for a comprehensive assessment.

**Next Steps**: Please ensure the complete contents of all files, especially `package.json`, are provided for a thorough external dependencies analysis.
