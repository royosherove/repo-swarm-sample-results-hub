Core entities and their relationships

# Domain Analysis: is-even Project

## Overview
Based on the analysis of the provided files, this appears to be a simple utility library for checking if numbers are even. The project has a very minimal domain model focused on mathematical operations.

## Common Data Entities/Domain Models

### 1. **Number (Input Value)**
**Description**: The primary data entity that represents the numerical input to be evaluated.

**Key Attributes/Fields**:
- `value`: The actual number to be checked (expected to be an integer or numeric value)
- `type`: Implicitly expected to be a number type

**Characteristics**:
- Should be a valid number
- The core subject of the even/odd evaluation logic

### 2. **Boolean Result**
**Description**: The output entity that represents the result of the even/odd check.

**Key Attributes/Fields**:
- `result`: Boolean value (true if even, false if odd)

## Entity Relationships

### Primary Relationship
```
Number (Input) --[1:1]--> Boolean (Result)
```

**Relationship Type**: One-to-One
- Each input number produces exactly one boolean result
- The relationship is functional: f(number) → boolean

## Domain Model Diagram

```
┌─────────────┐    evaluates    ┌─────────────┐
│   Number    │ ──────────────> │   Boolean   │
│             │                 │             │
│ - value     │                 │ - result    │
│ - type      │                 │             │
└─────────────┘                 └─────────────┘
```

## Key Observations

1. **Minimal Domain**: This is a utility library with an extremely simple domain model
2. **Single Operation**: The domain revolves around one core operation - determining if a number is even
3. **No Persistence**: There are no complex data structures, databases, or persistent entities
4. **Functional Nature**: The domain is primarily functional with a clear input-output relationship

## Domain Rules/Business Logic

- Input must be a valid number
- Even numbers return `true`
- Odd numbers return `false`
- The evaluation follows mathematical definition of even numbers (divisible by 2)

This project represents a minimal domain model typical of utility libraries focused on a single mathematical operation.

# DBs

databases analysis

After conducting a comprehensive scan of the provided codebase, I have analyzed all files including `index.js`, `README.md`, and `package.json`.

The codebase appears to be a simple utility library that determines whether a number is even or odd. There are no database connections, queries, ORM configurations, schema definitions, or any other database-related code present in any of the files.

# APIs

APIs analysis

Looking at the repository structure and files provided, I need to analyze the codebase for HTTP API endpoints.

Based on the repository structure:
- `index.js` - Main JavaScript file
- `README.md` - Documentation
- `package.json` - Package configuration

The repository name "is-even_23015aa5" suggests this is likely a utility library for checking if numbers are even, rather than an HTTP API service.

Without being able to see the actual contents of the files (particularly `index.js`), but based on:
1. The repository name indicating it's an "is-even" utility
2. The simple file structure with just an index.js file
3. No indication of web framework dependencies or server setup files

This appears to be a utility library rather than an HTTP API service.

**no HTTP API**

# security_check

Top 10 security vulnerabilities assessment

# Security Vulnerability Assessment

## TOP 10 Security Issues

After performing a comprehensive security assessment of the `is-even` codebase, I found the following security issues:

### Issue #1: Missing Input Validation
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Input Validation & Output Encoding
**Location:** 
- File: `index.js`
- Line(s): 1-3
- Function: module.exports

**Description:**
The function accepts any input without validation and directly passes it to the `is-odd` dependency. There's no type checking, range validation, or sanitization of the input parameter.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```javascript
module.exports = function isEven(i) {
  return !isOdd(i);
};
```

**Impact:**
An attacker could pass malicious payloads, objects, or unexpected data types that could cause unexpected behavior in the downstream `is-odd` module or in applications using this library.

**Fix Required:**
Add input validation to ensure the parameter is a valid number.

**Example Secure Implementation:**
```javascript
module.exports = function isEven(i) {
  if (typeof i !== 'number' || !Number.isInteger(i)) {
    throw new TypeError('Expected an integer');
  }
  return !isOdd(i);
};
```

### Issue #2: Vulnerable Dependency Chain
**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** Vulnerable Dependencies
**Location:**
- File: `package.json`
- Line(s): 23
- Dependency: is-odd

**Description:**
The package depends on the `is-odd` module (version ^3.0.1), which creates a dependency chain for a trivial mathematical operation that could be implemented directly.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```json
"dependencies": {
  "is-odd": "^3.0.1"
}
```

**Impact:**
Any vulnerabilities in the `is-odd` package or its dependencies would affect this package. The caret (^) range allows automatic updates to newer minor versions which could introduce breaking changes or vulnerabilities.

**Fix Required:**
Either implement the logic directly or use exact version pinning.

**Example Secure Implementation:**
```javascript
module.exports = function isEven(i) {
  if (typeof i !== 'number' || !Number.isInteger(i)) {
    throw new TypeError('Expected an integer');
  }
  return i % 2 === 0;
};
```

---

## Summary

1. **Overall Security Posture:** The codebase is minimal with limited attack surface, but has basic security hygiene issues around input validation and dependency management.

2. **Critical Issues Count:** 0

3. **Most Concerning Pattern:** Lack of input validation and unnecessary dependency usage for trivial operations.

4. **Priority Fixes:** 
   - Add input validation
   - Consider removing the dependency and implementing logic directly

5. **Implementation Issues:** 
   - No error handling
   - No input sanitization
   - Dependency on external module for basic mathematical operation

## Additional Security Issues Found

- **Architecture Design:** The package creates an unnecessary dependency chain for a simple modulo operation that could be implemented in 1-2 lines of code
- **Error Handling:** No error handling mechanism for invalid inputs
- **Type Safety:** No TypeScript definitions or runtime type checking

**Note:** This is a very simple utility package with minimal functionality, so the security risk profile is naturally low. The issues identified are primarily defensive programming practices rather than exploitable vulnerabilities.
